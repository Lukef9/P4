The naval combat game allows you to set up battle squadron groups, their formations and management, with realistic ship models and characteristics, as well as advanced ballistic and weapon models. \n\n(Alternative History) In the second half of 1880s, the policy of imperialism in the tropical Pacific led to a local naval conflict between the U.S., Chile, the German Empire and the Kingdom of Spain.\nNone of the contestants wanted a big war. Therefore, only the quick clash of colonial squadrons in tropical waters will decide who will rule Oceania.\n\n**************************************************************************************************************************\nPanama Crisis with Chile vs USA 1885\n\nIn 1884 Chile emerged from the War of the Pacific as a potential threat to the hegemony of the United States. The Chilean navy, then the strongest fleet in the Pacific, was able to confront American policy. In 1882 Chile refused US mediation in the War of the Pacific. In 1885, as the United States Navy occupied Colon, then part of Colombia, the Chilean government ordered its navy to occupy Panama City and to force the American squadron to evacuate Colon.\n\n**************************************************************************************************************************\nCaroline Islands Crisis with Germany vs Spain 1885\n\nGermany began her colonial enterprise very late and was, therefore, at a disadvantage, finding all the desirable places already occupied. The Spaniards claimed the Caroline Islands as their colony, but did not actually control them. Germany disputed the Spanish claim.\n\nIn August of 1885, Spain sent warships to Yap (Caroline Islands) to assert their territorial claim; however, the German government was aware of these ships and its squadron arrived the night before the Spanish landed.\n\n**************************************************************************************************************************\nMarianas Incident with Spain vs USA 1887\n\nTo strengthen its position in the Pacific Ocean; the United States needs to control at least one of the tropical islands such as the Spanish Mariana Islands, or the Samoan archipelago. Events in Cuba and internal problems did not allow Spain to strengthen its colony in Oceania. The Great powers were not interested in supporting the interests of Spain in the Pacific and did not interfere in the conflict. \n\nNone of the contestants wanted a big war. Therefore, only the quick clash of colonial squadrons in tropical waters will decide who will rule the Mariana Islands after 1887.\n\n**************************************************************************************************************************\n\nSamoan Crisis with Germany vs USA 1889\n\nThe Samoan archipelago is the last of the territories of Oceania which has not yet been colonized. The German Empire, through the tribal supreme chief, is trying to establish control over the Samoa. This leads to civil war between the natives. The United States supports the rebels. Governments of both nations have sent warships to the largest and busiest Apia harbor in Samoa. The commanders of naval squadrons ready for battle.

With Unidad’s military force unable to maintain control over Bolivia, the country is in a state of civil war. To help restore order, the Unidad enlists cartel members, veterans, mercenaries and criminals from various nearby countries as volunteers. Together, they form a new brutal special unit: Los Extranjeros, which is ordered to track and eliminate all American agents.  \n  \nIn this chaotic situation, the Ghosts have one last mission: evacuate the last CIA members and American civilians remaining in the country. Shot down en route to their mission, the Ghosts find themselves in the middle of the jungle, without external support, facing deadly enemies equipped with the latest gear and technology.   \n  \nThe Fallen Ghosts campaign will feature 15 new missions in which players will have to take down four new bosses located in three different regions. In the expansion, players will start with a new character at level 30 and equipped with all of the main game skills. The level cap will increase from 30 to 35, and players will be able to unlock nine new skills including physical, weapon and drones skills.  \n  \nFallen Ghosts also features six exclusive new weapons ranging from new assault rifles, sniper rifles and a crossbow that can be equipped with explosive arrows.  \n  \nFinally, the more hardcore players will be pleased to know that the advanced and expert difficulties have been tweaked to offer an even higher challenge.

There have been games where you command one ship, there have been others where you command a few or a fleet, and there have been 4X games in WWII, but never yet have we had the opportunity to build a base on one end of the map while we're simultaneously fighting a battle on another side and buying a new ship hoping we got it in time to get there and turn the tide of the battle. \n \nIn Flotilla WWII you will be building factories to increase your production, ships and aircraft to repel the enemy, ports to repair your ships, airfields to build your planes, and AA guns to protect your assets - all in the same map. \n \nThe game plays out as a turn-based strategy game, where you bring in your new units and assign them destination and target orders which they carry out when you end your turn. You will be balancing between building a strong economy and a strong military force, while your choice of ships will also be crucial. Will you try to gain the upper hand by rushing in small, fast ships, in an attempt to cripple the enemy's economy in a hit \u0026 run raid, or will you build up your forces silently, ready to unleash long-ranged carriers and cumbersome but powerful and durable battleships onto the enemy? Is investing in a port to repair your ships worth the resources, or are they better spent on more units? Will you firmly take over one island at a time, or will you go straight to the nearest enemy island, striking fast but hard from safety? You can test your strategies against your friends in multiplayer hotseat, or against a simple but very persistent and aggressive AI in noumerous randomly generated island maps, from 16x16 tiles (~5 minutes of play time) to enormous 256x256 tile maps (~2 hours of play time) as best you see fit.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[9760,55029,36594,22399,12982,2015,18623,24512,55036,21642],"tags":[22,39,268435471,268435472,536871911,536874428,536874717,1073741827],"game_engines":[103],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[999,3516,3805],"themes":[22,39],"genres":[15,16],"first_release_date":1470787200000,"status":3,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1495411200000,"region":8,"human":"2017-May-22","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1470787200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Aug-10","y":2016,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o1ofncx2xduyfaryftvn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o1ofncx2xduyfaryftvn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jrzrcdp5fzx3ynfp0snj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jrzrcdp5fzx3ynfp0snj","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hiaq43livdbupotsruxu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hiaq43livdbupotsruxu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djpgvsnwq36k65ozemhx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"djpgvsnwq36k65ozemhx","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/parh1hy9ujmkxoehbmsj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"parh1hy9ujmkxoehbmsj","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"7hcjvjA6YI4"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qhtzfj09b6zewhtvfauq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qhtzfj09b6zewhtvfauq","width":1205,"height":1205},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=748309980"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMGzTMH1slv3r1bg4EpYRFQ"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/FlotillaWWIIgame"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.indiedb.com/games/flotilla-wwii"}]},{"id":36699,"name":"Neckbeards: Basement Arena","slug":"neckbeards-basement-arena","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/neckbeards-basement-arena","created_at":1496537557527,"updated_at":1522209638395,"summary":"Put down that skipping rope and gym bag.

After being jolted awake by a tone over the airplane's PA system and a friendly conversation with a fellow passenger named David, a group of terrorists, who seem to be guided by some kind of mysterious cultist chanting to himself, suddenly and violently takes control of the plane. David, who turns out to be a special agent within the FBI, attempts to stop the terrorists, but he is thwarted when a meteorite strikes the plane, sending it crashing into the Canadian wilderness. After a series of bad dreams, Laura awakens in a small cabin being cared for by Kimberly Fox, a poet and songwriter who also survived the crash. She explains that ten days have passed since the accident, although Kimberly had only found her some distance from the crash site two days prior, leaving a strange eight-day gap where she was mysteriously taken care of. The moment of peace is broken when another survivor, one of the hijackers, staggers into the cabin before suddenly transforming into a hideous plant-like monster. Here, Laura and Kimberly meet Parker Jackson, a CETI researcher and fellow crash survivor who drives out the monster, only to be driven out himself by a distrusting Kimberly. \n \nLaura then sets out into the wilderness in order to investigate the possibility of contacting the outside world and seeking out other survivors only to discover that more strange, hideous creatures are lurking in the area, as something is causing the crash survivors to mutate into the very same monsters she must avoid and battle while travelling through the region. She is driven deeper into the mystery when she must venture into an abandoned mining facility in order to locate Jannie, a lost little girl Kimberly had found along with Laura and one of the plane's former passengers.","collection":2758,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[7329,25300,44076,36926,13189,26766,59516,19448,17001,25646],"tags":[1,19,21,268435468,268435487,536870976,536870984,536871251,536871541,536871814,536871938,536871939,536872032,536872140,536872328,536872622,536872647,536872746,536872748,536872793,536872873,536872983,536873111,536873249,536875057,536875400,536875483,536875523,536875542,536875572,536875951,536876287,536876413,536876631,536876642,536876652,536876687,536877264,536877501,536879820,536880215,536880223,536880251,1073741826,1073741825],"developers":[7053],"publishers":[4468,7053],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[64,72,339,629,902,1026,1027,1120,1228,1416,1710,1735,1834,1836,1881,1961,2071,2199,2337,4145,4488,4571,4611,4630,4660,5039,5375,5501,5719,5730,5740,5775,6352,6589,8908,9303,9311,9339],"themes":[1,19,21],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":945907200000,"platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":966902400000,"region":2,"human":"2000-Aug-22","y":2000,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":945907200000,"region":5,"human":"1999-Dec-23","y":1999,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ujogc0i1obswtktvzjvd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ujogc0i1obswtktvzjvd","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yzdpi7tpnjpc8n0sbaic.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yzdpi7tpnjpc8n0sbaic","width":409,"height":307}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"6azIWjcDeps"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"0GenB3zt2-Q"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ussmvi10auru3gegmxap.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ussmvi10auru3gegmxap","width":342,"height":291},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D2_(video_game)"}]},{"id":36737,"name":"Dynamite Cop","slug":"dynamite-cop","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dynamite-cop","created_at":1496607119441,"updated_at":1517271105484,"summary":"A beat 'em up video game published by Sega and initially released in arcades on Sega Model 2 hardware.

making its way to the Nintendo 3DS eShop. \n \nMiles has crash landed on a mysterious island and the local inhabitants are not happy about it. Run, jump, stomp and smash your way through 20 levels of non stop frantic action to escape from the island as fast as you can. \n \nLovingly converted by hand from the iOS source, the 3DS version is a pixel perfect recreation of the original game with all the original levels and gameplay elements. \n \nA new control scheme makes the game more accessible to casual players but the original two button hardcore controls are available for those who want more of a

After defeating them, queen Valia appears in front of Yuuko telling her that the sword named Valis summoned her to save the dream world, Vecanti, from the claws of the evil emperor Rogles, so she can also save the human world.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":538099200000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":538099200000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Jan-20","y":1987,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rx1f5edr0nncdzbrhwkj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rx1f5edr0nncdzbrhwkj","width":1824,"height":2614}},{"id":36790,"name":"Lupin III: Umi ni Kieta Hihou","slug":"lupin-iii-umi-ni-kieta-hihou","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lupin-iii-umi-ni-kieta-hihou","created_at":1496762210969,"updated_at":1515828347447,"summary":"An adventure game set in the Lupin III universe, released for GameCube.","collection":4155,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55803,29730,13189,66213,22482,22425,25222,11423,41895,22490],"tags":[268435487,536870990,536871939,536872581,536875054,536875180,536875222,536876505,536876833,536877025,536879184,536879788],"category":0,"keywords":[78,1027,1669,4142,4268,4310,5593,5921,6113,8272,8876],"genres":[31],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aehuup13bank4hh7g1mt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aehuup13bank4hh7g1mt","width":640,"height":909}},{"id":36791,"name":"Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side: 2nd Kiss","slug":"tokimeki-memorial-girls-side-2nd-kiss","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tokimeki-memorial-girls-side-2nd-kiss","created_at":1496762227066,"updated_at":1531911403120,"summary":"The protagonist is a high school student at Hanegasaki High School, located in Habataki City, the city of the first game (the game starts around the time the first game's protagonist graduates) While leading a normal high school life including academics, club activities and part-time work, it is also possible to become friendly with boys who can make a declaration of love on graduation day.","collection":3447,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[236,28010,22482,27209,99670,18992,15537,16315,103282,72812],"tags":[17,268435458,536870990,536871308,536872328,536872396,1073741828,1073741826],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,396,1416,1484],"themes":[17],"genres":[2],"first_release_date":1154563200000,"platforms":[20,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1202947200000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Feb-14","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1154563200000,"region":5,"human":"2006-Aug-03","y":2006,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c7z2mbrfpo6akeyjikam.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c7z2mbrfpo6akeyjikam","width":384,"height":256},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/axsjosw4qktvmtqnlr0a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"axsjosw4qktvmtqnlr0a","width":500,"height":339},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g6jjsgfeh1yrfywo7qfn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g6jjsgfeh1yrfywo7qfn","width":335,"height":225},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ppxxk1ah8ffeqdi28rf3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ppxxk1ah8ffeqdi28rf3","width":480,"height":360}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"qs424N3I_Jo"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/husluurorkgmvljdqnyl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"husluurorkgmvljdqnyl","width":1024,"height":768},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokimeki_Memorial_Girl%27s_Side:_2nd_Kiss"},{"category":2,"url":"https://tokimekimemorialgs.wikia.com/wiki/Tokimeki_Memorial_Girl%27s_Side_2nd_Season"}]},{"id":36792,"name":"Pokémon Ultra Sun","slug":"pokemon-ultra-sun","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pokemon-ultra-sun","created_at":1496762268468,"updated_at":1534976853509,"summary":"\"Take on the role of a Pokémon Trainer and uncover new tales, and unravel the mystery behind the two forms reminiscent of the Legendary Pokémon.

It was released for free online in 2005 for Microsoft Windows. It was the senior game project of students attending DigiPen Institute of Technology. The gameplay consists of navigating a dungeon using an innovative portal system. The player controls a pair of interconnected portals that can be placed on any non-metallic surface (wall, ceiling, or floor). Gabe Newell, managing director of Valve Corporation, took interest in the team's work and employed the whole staff at Valve. The developers went on to make Portal (2007) using many of the same concepts. \n \nThe word Narbacular, which does not exist in any dictionary, was chosen primarily to aid in internet search engine results. \n \nBeing mostly a proof of applied concept, the game contains only six puzzles to solve. However, members of the Narbacular Drop forum community have created a catalog of custom maps.","storyline":"A princess, called No-Knees due to her inability to jump, was admired by her entire kingdom. A demon, imagining her kidnap would help in his quest to conquer the world, captures Princess No-Knees. He then locks her inside a cage in his mountain lair, under patrol of his minion, Impy. However, Wally, the spirit of the mountain, was mad at the Demon for creating his dungeon lair inside his home. He tells No-Knees he would assist her in escaping as long as she helped him to defeat the demon and allows her to use his power of portal creation.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6732,7344,6705,7202,26769,10039,47823,28414,37094,1352],"tags":[1,17,22,268435461,268435464,268435465,536871063,536871208,536871506,536871878,536872287,536872334,536872441,536872885,536873095,536873249,536873362,536873671,536873787,536873904,536875057,536875151,536875208,536875242,536875244,536875271,536875316,536875437,536875606,536875667,536875670,536875690,536875760,536875768,536876011,536876205,536877626,536877960,536882290,1073741826,1073741825],"developers":[12877],"publishers":[12876],"game_engines":[473],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[151,296,594,966,1375,1422,1529,1973,2183,2337,2450,2759,2875,2992,4145,4239,4296,4330,4332,4359,4404,4525,4694,4755,4758,4778,4848,4856,5099,5293,6714,7048,11378],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[5,8,9],"first_release_date":1114905600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1114905600000,"region":8,"human":"2005-May-01","y":2005,"m":5}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/clamk20sojzjfdebjyzm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"clamk20sojzjfdebjyzm","width":1024,"height":768}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"oGEQ17Kr8xQ"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"UBfKcBxtYkI"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cpb1qoo9koqnjwmmw0fv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cpb1qoo9koqnjwmmw0fv","width":600,"height":100},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narbacular_Drop"},{"category":1,"url":"http://games.digipen.edu/games/narbacular-drop"}]},{"id":36810,"name":"Aliens: The Computer Game (Activision)","slug":"aliens-the-computer-game-activision","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/aliens-the-computer-game-activision","created_at":1496802851560,"updated_at":1496883101943,"franchise":23,"franchises":[23],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,36950,76246,64204,76722,19341,10039,27314,25311],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536872198,1073741826,1073741828],"developers":[66],"publishers":[7405,66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1286],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[75,15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":567907200000,"region":2,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zxulwefpui6xceshiuro.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zxulwefpui6xceshiuro","width":1000,"height":1283}},{"id":36811,"name":"Aliens: Alien 2","slug":"aliens-alien-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/aliens-alien-2","created_at":1496803207070,"updated_at":1515614558067,"summary":"Aliens: Alien 2 is an arcade platformer (or run'n'gun if you like) featuring Ripley on a planet infested with aliens.

(each with their own tiny achievements!) \n- 80+ achievements that will make you feel good about yourself \n- 100s of collectible little squishy tumors! \n- loads of hidden extras and endings that you will probably see someone else find before you do! \n- and stress!\"","hypes":2,"rating":80.0,"popularity":16.66666666666666,"aggregated_rating":74.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":77.16666666666666,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":4,"games":[47823,80916,28168,24426,23733,26226,19150,33269,55752,11364],"tags":[1,268435464,268435487,268435488,536870981,536871208,536871817,536871945,536872961,536874327,536876436,1073741828],"developers":[4672,12884],"publishers":[3701,4672,12884],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[69,296,905,1033,2049,3415,5524],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,31,32],"first_release_date":1499817600000,"pulse_count":35,"platforms":[6,14,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1502668800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Aug-14","y":2017,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1513036800000,"human":"2017-Dec-12","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1499817600000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jul-12","y":2017,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ftqldlmn7sx1bs4kerig.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ftqldlmn7sx1bs4kerig","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dmvjmwxewytfuuyr6gih.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dmvjmwxewytfuuyr6gih","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8ujsrsh2kgtw7eomwbh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s8ujsrsh2kgtw7eomwbh","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ptdcnb0zekqauk5n1w1l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ptdcnb0zekqauk5n1w1l","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lknckit6w7potv9b17vl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lknckit6w7potv9b17vl","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jmwk2ngfktetezxqn1tf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jmwk2ngfktetezxqn1tf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bwsrmrwklje93m8monnx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bwsrmrwklje93m8monnx","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/grdxi4bodyrij3cwiscf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"grdxi4bodyrij3cwiscf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ysxiwu7qw8xsqy54yooj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ysxiwu7qw8xsqy54yooj","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kaivwibbl1nu32or4rje.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kaivwibbl1nu32or4rje","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/puh4zn4wqkupmijm34ot.jpg","cloudinary_id":"puh4zn4wqkupmijm34ot","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/x1dwmzc7xynaozkpa1av.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x1dwmzc7xynaozkpa1av","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"KJ71Wz90zt4"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fz8ggy5kvjierbg5m01g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fz8ggy5kvjierbg5m01g","width":460,"height":215},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_Is_Nigh_(video_game)"},{"category":2,"url":"https://theendisnigh.gamepedia.com/The_End_is_Nigh_Wiki"},{"category":1,"url":"http://yourendisnigh.com/"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/583470"}],"external":{"steam":"583470"}},{"id":36847,"name":"NHL 18","slug":"nhl-18","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nhl-18","created_at":1496892085517,"updated_at":1534522183337,"summary":"It's true!

Her quest takes her far from her home, across the continent in pursuit of a thief whose actions stem from a sinister plot.  \n  \nIts character-driven plot focuses on the interactions between Celeste and her companions as they hunt down the thief. Our goal is to make the game lighthearted and humorous, yet still tell a compelling story.  \n  \nDestiny Chronicles features an exciting and fast-paced action combat system like that of Kingdom Hearts and Celeste’s fighting style can be customized to suit your playstyle with a talent tree and upgrade system.  \n  \nThe game is currently in the early development phase and we will be running a Kickstarter soon.\"","storyline":"\"For centuries, the Ashen Order has protected the people of Darencia from monsters. Celeste, a young squire training to join the knighthood, is sent to the forest village of Ornwood to prove herself worthy by retrieving an ancient artifact that has corrupted the forest.  \n  \nWhen a mysterious young woman steals the artifact before Celeste can take it, she fails her initiation. Determined to prove herself, Celeste leaves home to find the thief, reclaim the artifact, and become a knight.  \n  \nBut the outside world is much different than the isolated society Celeste grew up in, and she joins forces with the mercenary Valana and the researcher mage Ruby. Their journey takes them across a continent filled with mysterious ruins, remnants of an ancient civilization that crumbled ages ago. No one knows who they were or why they fell, and the stolen artifact is one of the few remaining relics from their era.  \n  \nThe more Celeste sees of the world, the more she questions not only her mission, but also the role of the knighthood. Is it right for them to remain separate from the rest of the world? Do they protect people as much as they claim, or have they prioritized the artifacts they seek above the lives of the people they claim to protect?  \n  \nOne thing is certain: the woman who took the artifact is no ordinary thief, and the stolen artifact is only the tip of a dark plot.

As players traverse various environments, they engage in quests and use swords, lances, and bow guns to hunt and kill their quarry (e.g., dragons, dinosaurs, winged beasts). Battles are frenetic and accompanied by sword slashes, impact sounds, and large explosions. Some areas depict mass monster graves containing large pools of blood and blood-stained bones. In one of the game's environments, players' character may sit down at a table and drink mugs of beer; if players continue to consume alcohol, a drunk animation will appear (e.g., character collapsing on the table; character stumbling around and falling down). The words “p*ssed off” appear in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/MONSTER_HUNTER_WORLD"},{"category":14,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunterWorld"},{"category":2,"url":"http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter:_World"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/monsterhunter"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/monsterhuntergame"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/monsterhunter"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/monsterhunter"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter:_World"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.monsterhunterworld.com/"}],"external":{"steam":"582010"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":16,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":36927,"name":"Hazelnut Bastille","slug":"hazelnut-bastille","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hazelnut-bastille","created_at":1497092352562,"updated_at":1518097113574,"summary":"Hazelnut Bastille is a top-down Metroidvania with mechanics, design and art-style rooted in the SNES classics of the early 90's.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741827],"developers":[14790],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[477,1705],"genres":[31],"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":3,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":14,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":6,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/slds7tykcpmkzljg1axk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"slds7tykcpmkzljg1axk","width":864,"height":648},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p4yozat0lrqnj5kdofpg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p4yozat0lrqnj5kdofpg","width":864,"height":648},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jbj9xcdw0oal8lgrujfd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jbj9xcdw0oal8lgrujfd","width":864,"height":648},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q5zll9vyx7lvwypytvni.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q5zll9vyx7lvwypytvni","width":864,"height":648},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/no14xmxoybnx9tmsltkt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"no14xmxoybnx9tmsltkt","width":575,"height":431},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qwkftjbj4d8upj6ufzmq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qwkftjbj4d8upj6ufzmq","width":567,"height":425}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/euylfbpuwfftvy5f5xoo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"euylfbpuwfftvy5f5xoo","width":900,"height":614},"websites":[{"category":14,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/aloftstudio/submitted"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/AloftStudio"},{"category":1,"url":"https://www.aloftstudio.com/hazelnutbastille"}]},{"id":36928,"name":"Coming Out On Top","slug":"coming-out-on-top","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/coming-out-on-top","created_at":1497092515245,"updated_at":1523345642108,"summary":"The acclaimed gay dating sim.

As their kingdoms grew, many leaders took to greed and corruption  to fulfill their thirst for power. War broke out, factions separated and became isolated as they slayed one another, creating more efficient means at eliminating the enemy. Out of the war came great users of magic and alchemy. Machines were created to house and harness this magic and as the war darkened, a solitary warlock sought to end the war. Creating the first Omen Gates, monsters spewed forth from the darkest corners of existence. The Sakura, demonic creatures of darkness, slayed hundreds of thousand. The war over, but an extermination began. Soon the Sakura overthrew their magical overlords, as the last kingdoms fell the few remaining leaders united. Congregating alchemists, mechanics, and magicians alike they forged new magical war machines. Magical walls and living forests to defeat the Sakura. Though considered a victory the Sakura were never removed. With the war never won, the Ulan united kingdom soon split.  \n \n\tThe Ulan kingdom remained in control of Beasts of war and powerful warlocks.

These mages who delved into the Astral Plane became corrupt and vengeful as the spirits were around them.

Set in a different universe from the original Mazinger story, the story begins in the year 1999 AD, when God Kaiser Hell began an all-out invasion to control Earth using powerful giants known as 'Bio Beasts'. Mazinger Z in Mazin Saga is actually a suit of armor rather than a robot. This armor has the ability to transform into a giant version of itself, allowing Mazinger Z to battle the Bio Beasts. \n \nMazinger Z's design in Mazin Saga is a departure from the rest of the Mazingers. Here, Mazinger Z is given an all-blue color rather than black in white like the others. Colored orbs are mounted on Mazinger Z's crown and torso. In many instances, Mazinger Z dons a red cape and its only weapon in combat is a sword, similar to God Mazinger. \n \nThe characters from the original Mazinger Z series reprise their roles in Mazin Saga, albeit slightly different from their anime/manga counterparts. Dr. Hell appears in Mazin Saga as God Kaiser Hell. Koji Kabuto still plays the protagonist, but has as darker, more serious persona than featured in the anime and manga versions of Mazinger Z. Even Garada K7, one of the earliest enemies Mazinger Z fought in the original series, reappears as a Bio Beast.","franchise":1032,"franchises":[1032],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[71455,41828,28029,10039,36794,25311,68287,76213,75089,51464],"tags":[1,18,268435460,268435481,268435489,536871019,536872270,536873560,536873639,1073741828],"developers":[12916],"publishers":[1666,4468,1192],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[107,1358,2648,2727],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4,25,33],"first_release_date":730598400000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":730598400000,"region":2,"human":"1993-Feb-25","y":1993,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":730857600000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Feb-28","y":1993,"m":2},{"category":5,"platform":29,"date":749347200000,"region":1,"human":"1993-Q3","y":1993,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MazinSaga"},{"name":"Mazin Wars","comment":"European title"},{"name":"Mazin Saga","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"マジン・サーガ","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ghqe9aln5ub5o8r2f0mt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ghqe9aln5ub5o8r2f0mt","width":640,"height":448},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hidkfbegtgqs0wm4v6vb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hidkfbegtgqs0wm4v6vb","width":387,"height":306},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vshdjtq6tbjbdl3q8b58.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vshdjtq6tbjbdl3q8b58","width":320,"height":221},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jh9k5t6oiilbi82mtke1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jh9k5t6oiilbi82mtke1","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mtmgdqidtrcy1qxearfo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mtmgdqidtrcy1qxearfo","width":320,"height":240}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"GwM4vzyfmOI"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vigfhgvlqajojs8kzuoj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vigfhgvlqajojs8kzuoj","width":300,"height":427},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazin_Saga:_Mutant_Fighter"}]},{"id":36948,"name":"569","slug":"569","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/569","created_at":1497114413707,"updated_at":1497114413707,"popularity":1.0,"category":0},{"id":36949,"name":"570","slug":"570","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/570","created_at":1497114413745,"updated_at":1497114413745,"popularity":1.0,"category":0},{"id":36950,"name":"Anthem","slug":"anthem","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/anthem","created_at":1497124237539,"updated_at":1536056905872,"summary":"Anthem is a shared-world action RPG, where players can delve into a vast landscape teeming with amazing technology and forgotten treasures.

is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of an American soldier (B.J. Blazkowicz) in an alternate universe where the Nazis won World War II. As players help B.J. and his comrades escape various situations, they use traditional and futuristic firearms (e.g., pistols, shotguns, laser blasters, grenade launchers) to kill enemy soldiers and larger mechanized units. Combat is frenetic, with realistic gunfire, explosions, screams of pain, and large blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to blow off enemies' heads or cut off their limbs; cutscenes sometimes show decapitations and/or acts of disembowelment. One scene briefly depicts a clothed couple engaging in sexual activity (a character straddling another); moaning sounds can be heard before the couple appears on screen. A handful of scenes depict female characters with exposed breasts: a woman breastfeeding a baby; a woman's shirt getting torn off during a firefight. During the course of the game, a character is seen ingesting a hallucinogenic drug (e.g., sheet of acid, tab of LSD); both sequences involve instances of hallucination.

As players engage in melee-style combat, some sequences are highlighted by slow-motion effects, particularly for decapitations. Large blood-splatter effects also occur during combat, and some environments are stained with blood or body parts (e.g., heads impaled on spikes). Some sequences allow players to injure/kill non-adversary characters, including bound prisoners; they scream in pain amid splashes of blood or fire. As the game progresses, the dialogue and on-screen text contain references to sexual material (e.g., “She. . .raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her”; “Remember when you thought [he] was. . .intent on making you. . .into his personal sex slave?”). Alcohol such as wine, mead, and ale can be purchased and consumed by players' character throughout the game; in one sequence, players can engage in a drinking contest with another character, which eventually results in slurred speech (e.g., “One more.

Well that was what he called it, but I think he was the only one having any fun in there.”). Depictions of call-girl posters and pictures can be seen in one area.

Alien creatures generally cry out in pain then disappear when defeated. Some hand-drawn images briefly depict dead aliens on the ground. One scene briefly depicts an alien corpse in a puddle of green blood. Depending on how fast players complete the game, Samus is either shown wearing her full suit, her suit minus the helmet, or a leotard underneath the suit at the elapsed time-completion screen.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards fantasy characters - Pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid:_Samus_Returns"},{"category":1,"url":"https://metroidsamusreturns.nintendo.com/"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid:_Samus_Returns"}]},{"id":37141,"name":"That's You!","slug":"thats-you","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/thats-you","created_at":1497378954990,"updated_at":1534518021162,"summary":"Which of your family members would survive longest in the wild?","collection":3003,"popularity":3.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":69.25,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":69.25,"total_rating_count":5,"games":[36926,103339,23733,22387,55216,28028,33374,36950,28113,14362],"tags":[40,536871936,536875066,536875136,536875638,536881706,536888850,536888851],"publishers":[13634],"category":0,"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[1024,4154,4224,4726,10794,17938,17939],"themes":[40],"first_release_date":1499126400000,"platforms":[48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1508803200000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Oct-24","y":2017,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1499126400000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Jul-04","y":2017,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"That's Shu","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m4x9xktl6smyaoka5ozn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m4x9xktl6smyaoka5ozn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mvtvkj52nwtdsy3h5eoq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mvtvkj52nwtdsy3h5eoq","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hyyipfjwiaf6sj1egmh9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hyyipfjwiaf6sj1egmh9","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hjzxstmpur9hijctj8wi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hjzxstmpur9hijctj8wi","width":1280,"height":738},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ai3idqgmludu9bdd3e2t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ai3idqgmludu9bdd3e2t","width":3840,"height":2160}],"videos":[{"name":"E3 2017 Trailer","video_id":"YV_1elZqxqc"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xwgwhsuvfhymi3p6gvxl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xwgwhsuvfhymi3p6gvxl","width":6170,"height":3389}},{"id":37143,"name":"Bravo Team","slug":"bravo-team","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bravo-team","created_at":1497380275045,"updated_at":1534361526895,"summary":"Take aim.

It can hop up plants and walls, and slide along the floor for faster movement. To defend itself from dangers – which include wildlife and acid rain - the Leg can shoot the Ball which it carries, or use a smart bomb if the going gets tough. Contact with any danger loses the Leg energy. Chalk can be collected which protects it from the acid rain. \n \nThe Ball can also be thrown out to collect heat, which must be stored in the Leg so that it can be given to the three Triphylios plants. If it has stored enough energy, the plants open petals to block the acid rain.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":649468800000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":649468800000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Aug-01","y":1990,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhw3lm2rwf4lsbsb1wko.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fhw3lm2rwf4lsbsb1wko","width":878,"height":1132}},{"id":37153,"name":"Ping Pong","slug":"ping-pong","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ping-pong","created_at":1497398605425,"updated_at":1500209781987,"summary":"Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis.

There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring).

By praising or scolding Pino you will gradually make him understand what should be done and what not.","collection":5032,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,25300,19301,22425,25311,26145,19448,36950,27314,22436],"tags":[18,268435468,268435469,268435487,536871818,536871882,536871938,536871939,536872060,536875297,536875472,536877370,536880637],"category":0,"keywords":[906,970,1026,1027,1148,4385,4560,6458,9725],"themes":[18],"genres":[12,13,31],"first_release_date":789609600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":789609600000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jan-09","y":1995,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Wonder Project J: Mechanical Boy Pino","comment":"Other"}]},{"id":37256,"name":"Winter Olympic Games: Lillehammer '94","slug":"winter-olympic-games-lillehammer-94","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/winter-olympic-games-lillehammer-94","created_at":1497606020238,"updated_at":1500597206118,"summary":"Play the hottest game on ice and snow - Winter Olympic Games, the official licensed version of the 1994 Lillehammer Olympic Winter Games.

Rather than navigating through a single city, the player character is guided through a variety of puzzles and mazes. Players must take care in acquiring certain items over the course of the journey, lest they be stymied by an inescapable trap. Though there is no visible time limit, a number of pre-scripted events require players to act quickly in order to reach the next sequence. \n \nAs is standard in most Leisure Suit Larry games, the protagonist Larry Laffer's interactions with female non-player characters are accompanied by an on-screen portrait, though the images are much smaller than seen previously. The game actively punishes Larry for flirting with any woman he meets, a marked departure from the rest of the series; such acts invariably leads to Larry's violent death and a game over.

The game also only contains 4 levels so replayability-value has also been considered a negative factor.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68324,36608,47823,12632,34919,27209,36926,16468,23175,40524],"tags":[1,268435463,536871208],"category":0,"keywords":[296],"themes":[1],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":978739200000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":978739200000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jan-06","y":2001,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/udzahisx9wsev6memppj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"udzahisx9wsev6memppj","width":319,"height":451}},{"id":37356,"name":"Raku Jongg","slug":"raku-jongg","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/raku-jongg","created_at":1497729632343,"updated_at":1500620771900,"summary":"Raku Jongg is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Enterbrain and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2001.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":993945600000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":993945600000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jul-01","y":2001,"m":7}]},{"id":37357,"name":"Pocket no Naka no Doraemon","slug":"pocket-no-naka-no-doraemon","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pocket-no-naka-no-doraemon","created_at":1497729634386,"updated_at":1500620763105,"summary":"Pocket no Naka no Doraemon is a Strategy game, developed and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2001.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":993340800000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":993340800000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jun-24","y":2001,"m":6}]},{"id":37358,"name":"Naruto: Konoha Ninpouchou","slug":"naruto-konoha-ninpouchou","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/naruto-konoha-ninpouchou","created_at":1497729679033,"updated_at":1516726572033,"summary":"Naruto: Konoha Ninpouchou is a Role-Playing game, developed by Bec and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2003.","collection":2306,"franchise":221,"franchises":[221],"popularity":2.0,"games":[19567,12632,28010,25650,49414,70861,47158,26766,36608,25300],"tags":[268435468,536870973,536870990,536871938],"category":0,"keywords":[61,78,1026],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1048723200000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":1048723200000,"region":5,"human":"2003-Mar-27","y":2003,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":1051401600000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Apr-27","y":2003,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Naruto: Konoha Ninpōchō","comment":"Acronym"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zathaboycmwdrymuir7y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zathaboycmwdrymuir7y","width":215,"height":327}},{"id":37359,"name":"Namco Super Wars","slug":"namco-super-wars","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/namco-super-wars","created_at":1497729683966,"updated_at":1516737263479,"summary":"Namco Super Wars is a tactical role-playing game developed by Namco and published by Bandai for the Wonderswan Color. It is a crossover game, featuring characters from several classic Namco titles. \n \nThe game is played on a square grid, on which both the player's and computer's units are placed. Each side takes turns moving and making actions with their units. Every character has a variety of attacks and special moves that can be selected when performing an action. Some of these consume Spirit Points, which slowly regenerate each turn. The game is divided into stages. Between each stage, the player is able to visit a shop and prepare his units before starting the next stage. Unlike most RPGs, characters do not gain levels for directly defeating opponents. Instead, completion of a map will reward the players with a number of level ups, which they can then distribute among their units as they wish.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55036,23345,19376,55590,19934,26769,27092,76731,9199],"tags":[268435471,536871938,536871987,536874694,536874810,536875093,536878089],"category":0,"keywords":[1026,1075,3782,3898,4181,7177],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":1036022400000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":1036022400000,"region":5,"human":"2002-Oct-31","y":2002,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":1038700800000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Dec-01","y":2002,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/auh14oxci6a6n00xkwsz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"auh14oxci6a6n00xkwsz","width":640,"height":904}},{"id":37360,"name":"Mikeneko Holmes: Ghost Panic","slug":"mikeneko-holmes-ghost-panic","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mikeneko-holmes-ghost-panic","created_at":1497729688448,"updated_at":1516606167957,"summary":"Mikeneko Holmes: Ghost Panic is an Adventure game, developed by Koto and published by Koubunsha, which was released in Japan in 2001.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55803,29730,13189,25222,41895,22482,70861,22425,61267,11296],"tags":[268435487,536870990,536871939],"category":0,"keywords":[78,1027],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":990835200000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":990835200000,"region":8,"human":"2001-May-26","y":2001,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gvqjqn3liwj30nqatqqi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gvqjqn3liwj30nqatqqi","width":280,"height":400}},{"id":37361,"name":"Memories Off Festa","slug":"memories-off-festa","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/memories-off-festa","created_at":1497729690847,"updated_at":1516765006530,"summary":"Memories Off Festa is an Adventure game, developed and published by Kid, which was released in Japan in 2001.","collection":966,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55803,29730,13189,25222,41895,22482,70861,22425,61267,11296],"tags":[268435487,536870990,536871939],"category":0,"keywords":[78,1027],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":986688000000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":986688000000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Apr-08","y":2001,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gwangbcsrpmc0gx3s9zy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gwangbcsrpmc0gx3s9zy","width":215,"height":315}},{"id":37362,"name":"Meitantei Conan: Yuugure no Ouju","slug":"meitantei-conan-yuugure-no-ouju","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/meitantei-conan-yuugure-no-ouju","created_at":1497729701303,"updated_at":1516564468099,"summary":"Meitantei Conan: Yuugure no Ouju is an Adventure game, developed by Tomcat System and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2001.","collection":3038,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[70861,55803,14605,29730,43130,17469,23175,28277,27266,63734],"tags":[268435487,536870990],"category":0,"keywords":[78],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":989884800000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":989884800000,"region":8,"human":"2001-May-15","y":2001,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vxm0fumalb6k45eoqwvv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vxm0fumalb6k45eoqwvv","width":344,"height":512}},{"id":37363,"name":"Last Alive","slug":"last-alive","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/last-alive","created_at":1497729704749,"updated_at":1500620698258,"summary":"Last Alive is an Adventure game, developed and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2001.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":998784000000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":998784000000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Aug-26","y":2001,"m":8}]},{"id":37364,"name":"Kurupara!","slug":"kurupara","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kurupara","created_at":1497729707082,"updated_at":1500620688874,"summary":"Kurupara! is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Tom Create, which was released in Japan in 2001.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":995068800000,"platforms":[123],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":123,"date":995068800000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jul-14","y":2001,"m":7}]},{"id":37365,"name":"Kinnikuman Nisei: Dream Tag Match","slug":"kinnikuman-nisei-dream-tag-match","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kinnikuman-nisei-dream-tag-match","created_at":1497729709729,"updated_at":1515841659058,"summary":"Kinnikuman Nisei: Dream Tag Match is a wrestling game based in the manga/anime series of the same name.

The player oversees a 10 x 10 square field where the first four rows (three on easy) have been filled by blocks. Each block shows one of three symbols, a dark gray circle, a light gray circle, and a white circle. When ever any of blocks with matching symbols touch they will form a link. By moving the cursor over a chain and clicking on it the player will be given points based on its size on the chain will be removed. The goal is to get a large score while making sure that new pieces can still enter the field. Once no more pieces can enter the game ends. Blocks fall at the same time one square apart, when the next set of blocks fall they will occupy the space given by the previous drop. \n \nThe \"magnet\" aspect of Mingle Magnet come into play in how the player can control the placement of the blocks. All the blocks are attracted to a magnet which, although not seen, can be placed on any side of the field. All blocks will be drawn to the magnet. For example, if one has the magnet at the south of the field and then puts it to the north what was the top of the block pile will now be the bottom, and blocks will fall onto what was the bottom. The direction of the magnet is indicated by a magnetic field animation behind the action. \n \nThis game is played vertically.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[60044,25222,14047,19222,41348,26223,10225,27266,83207,83155],"tags":[268435465,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[2875],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":944092800000,"platforms":[57],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":57,"date":944092800000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Dec-02","y":1999,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jfg9nwrjeg1hx4niq4hx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jfg9nwrjeg1hx4niq4hx","width":1046,"height":1298}},{"id":37568,"name":"Meitantei Conan: Nishi no Meitantei Saidai no Kiki!?","slug":"meitantei-conan-nishi-no-meitantei-saidai-no-kiki","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/meitantei-conan-nishi-no-meitantei-saidai-no-kiki","created_at":1497872642144,"updated_at":1516564805714,"summary":"Meitantei Conan: Nishi no Meitantei Saidai no Kiki!? is an Adventure game, developed by Tomcat System and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2000.","collection":3038,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[70861,55803,14605,29730,43130,17469,23175,28277,27266,63734],"tags":[268435487,536870990],"category":0,"keywords":[78],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":967334400000,"platforms":[57],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":57,"date":967334400000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Aug-27","y":2000,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pjl5fxrsjjvtjpidjzp4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pjl5fxrsjjvtjpidjzp4","width":309,"height":384}},{"id":37569,"name":"Meitantei Conan: Majutsushi no Chousenjou!","slug":"meitantei-conan-majutsushi-no-chousenjou","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/meitantei-conan-majutsushi-no-chousenjou","created_at":1497872643874,"updated_at":1516564487753,"summary":"Meitantei Conan is an Adventure game, developed by Tomcat System and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1999.","collection":3038,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[70861,55803,14605,29730,43130,17469,23175,28277,27266,63734],"tags":[268435487,536870990],"category":0,"keywords":[78],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":936489600000,"platforms":[57],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":57,"date":936489600000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Sep-05","y":1999,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/krukdeim0ymqtgnsqanj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"krukdeim0ymqtgnsqanj","width":240,"height":300}},{"id":37570,"name":"Medarot: Perfect Edition - Kuwagata Version","slug":"medarot-perfect-edition-kuwagata-version","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/medarot-perfect-edition-kuwagata-version","created_at":1497872645942,"updated_at":1500619681622,"summary":"Medarot: Perfect Edition - Kuwagata Version is a Role-Playing game, developed by Natsume and published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1999.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":928454400000,"platforms":[57],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":57,"date":928454400000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Jun-04","y":1999,"m":6}]},{"id":37571,"name":"Medarot: Perfect Edition - Kabuto Version","slug":"medarot-perfect-edition-kabuto-version","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/medarot-perfect-edition-kabuto-version","created_at":1497872647966,"updated_at":1500619672987,"summary":"Medarot: Perfect Edition - Kabuto Version is a Role-Playing game, developed by Natsume and published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1999.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":928454400000,"platforms":[57],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":57,"date":928454400000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Jun-04","y":1999,"m":6}]},{"id":37572,"name":"Meta Communication Therapy: Nee Kiite!","slug":"meta-communication-therapy-nee-kiite","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/meta-communication-therapy-nee-kiite","created_at":1497872649729,"updated_at":1500619664421,"summary":"Meta Communication Therapy: Nee Kiite!

One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe. \n \nAlshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style. \n \nThe bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A \"party talk\" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100. \n \nThe Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36926,59516,47823,12632,55289,26766,25300,18398,25311,36534],"tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536871208,536871938,536871939],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,1027],"themes":[1],"genres":[12,31],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rwxufs6vmryl44tqpjmu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rwxufs6vmryl44tqpjmu","width":640,"height":632}},{"id":37579,"name":"Bakushou Yoshimoto ShinkiGeki","slug":"bakushou-yoshimoto-shinkigeki","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bakushou-yoshimoto-shinkigeki","created_at":1497872878041,"updated_at":1516644885530,"summary":"A Japanese comedy platformer","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44177,36868,26848,67034,65980,63397,61268,59451,56132,63138],"tags":[27,268435464,536871262,536872961],"category":0,"keywords":[350,2049],"themes":[27],"genres":[8],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/njckcoegprbrs6dtr0zo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"njckcoegprbrs6dtr0zo","width":1407,"height":1397}},{"id":37580,"name":"Gotzendiener","slug":"gotzendiener--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gotzendiener--1","created_at":1497872879496,"updated_at":1516174334532,"summary":"Your knight in shining armor has just slain your captor, but has now succumb to his injuries.

Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level).

Matsuura, hot off the disbanding of his pop group PSY'S, wrote a vocal song and some incidental music for the game. As for the game itself, it's a rather standard shooter, but is also notable as an early creation of Flight Plan, the developer that went on to create such notable titles as Summon Night, Black/Matrix, Poison Pink, et al. Definitely worth a go if you're a fan of either Matsuura or Flight Plan, and a decent enough, if merely workmanlike effort otherwise. Try it. \nI actually bought a copy of this game when last I was in Tokyo, and presented it to Matsuura at his office during an informal interview. He was incredibly surprised to see the game, as he'd lost the original copy of the track, and ripped the disc on the spot in order to get it back! Pretty nifty. Honestly though, I only played it for about 30 minutes.

The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game's heroes Proco and Tiat. Darius' inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius' societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army.

Two new power-ups were added: a yellow powerup that adds a new \"laser\" main weapon that functions somewhat similarly to the bombs, and a rainbow powerup that grants one upgrade to all the players weapons. \n \nActually acquiring these powerups and the upgrade path is completely different from Darius: a formation of a specific enemy must be completely destroyed (and a given formation may not have a powerup), and every single powerup now grants some kind of upgrade. Further, the various weapons upgrade differently, though the shield upgrade the same as before. \n \nAnother new feature in Darius II is the appearance of minibosses known as \"captains\"; large enemies that appear somewhere in the level before the main boss.

The gameplay is at least partly inspired by Falcom's Ys series. \n \nMakai Hakkenden Shada is an action-RPG from Data East that was released on the PC Engine (the Japanese TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. The game bears more than a close resemblance to Falcom's Ys: specifically the first game in the series, The Vanished Omens, which was a huge success for the PC Engine a few months prior as well as being a generally well-regarded computer RPG before then. As well as having a similar nude female figure in the opening intro, the game also borrows Ys's combat system: fighting occurs by walking into enemies at a slight angle, causing them to collide with the player character's weapon (which hurts them) rather than the player character himself (which hurts the player character). The various gauges for health and experience are also similar. \n \nMakai Hakkenden Shada is based on a centuries-old Japanese novel series called Nansou Satomi Hakkenden, or \"Eight Dog Chronicles\", that features eight half-brother samurai who are all descended from the same dog and have the Japanese word for \"dog\" somewhere in their names. While these books have been referenced or adapted many times in other media such as manga and film, Makai Hakkenden Shada and the Famicom RPGs Satomi Hakkenden and Shin Satomi Hakkenden: Hikari to Yami no Tatakai are the only direct video game adaptations. Okami also contained an oblique reference to the novels. \n \nUnlike Satomi Hakkenden, which eventually allowed the player to recruit all eight of the central characters of the novel series, Makai Hakkenden Shada only has the one playable character. Instead, other characters from the novels occasionally appear to help the player.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":609984000000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":609984000000,"region":8,"human":"1989-May-01","y":1989,"m":5}]},{"id":37676,"name":"Mahjong Shikaku Retsuden: Mahjong Wars","slug":"mahjong-shikaku-retsuden-mahjong-wars","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mahjong-shikaku-retsuden-mahjong-wars","created_at":1497874553567,"updated_at":1516651251824,"summary":"A dual Mahjong game/RPG from Nihon Bussan. \n \nMahjong Shikaku Retsuden: Mahjong Wars (\"Mahjong Assassin Chronicles: Mahjong Wars\") is a PC Engine Mahjong game from Nichibutsu/Nihon Bussan, related to their Mahjong Triple Wars game.

The series would continue to acquire the various licenses needed to use real names from Formula 1.","collection":3209,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[58785,40470,80441,73154,72624,71804,69092,68306,67589,66335],"tags":[268435466,536874337,536875069,536875117],"category":0,"keywords":[3425,4157,4205],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":653270400000,"platforms":[86,18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":697420800000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Feb-07","y":1992,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":653270400000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Sep-14","y":1990,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":655862400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Oct-14","y":1990,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/luqsv8zw8tv7tnqneal4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"luqsv8zw8tv7tnqneal4","width":467,"height":467}},{"id":37716,"name":"DOWNLOAD","slug":"download","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/download","created_at":1497875752545,"updated_at":1516674767941,"summary":"Horizontal shoot 'em up for the PC Engine. The player, as cyber-diver Syd, must fly his hoverbike through the future city of Kabukicho to rescue his partner Deva from the corrupt police. \n \nOverview \nDownload is a horizontal shoot 'em up set in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which the main character, Syd, is haunted by memories of his friend Ohala falling to a cybernetic menace. Meanwhile, he receives a call from his contact/partner Deva and must rush to her rescue when she is abducted by the Kabukicho police force. The game's story is depicted in a series of animated vignettes before each stage, similar to Ninja Gaiden. Beginning with the mean streets of Kabukicho, Syd will eventually jack into the internet and fights in a similar manner through cyberspace. \n \nDownload is perhaps best known for its profanity-laden game over messages. It was followed by a PC Engine CD sequel the following year: Download 2. \n \nGameplay \nSyd's hoverbike has variable loadouts that the player can assign at the start of each level. These weapons can be upgraded further by finding power-ups within the level. The chief weapon, which can be fired infinitely, include a focused laser weapon and a scattered beam shot: the former is best for bosses and stronger foes, while the latter can quickly eliminate large crowds of weaker enemies. The player will often need to play each level a few times to determine the best loadout. \n \nThe player can also select between three sub-weapons: chaser missiles, which home in on foes; crusher, which absorbs shots and causes explosions; and barrier, which stops shots for a short time. Each sub-weapon has a finite number of uses which can be replenished by finding the right power-ups.","popularity":1.0,"games":[68287,71455,26766,10209,20019,25300,36950,70861,37618,76776],"tags":[18,536870990,536871015,536871078,536871882],"category":0,"keywords":[78,103,166,970],"themes":[18],"first_release_date":646012800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":646012800000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Jun-22","y":1990,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/svukskjwdhoqegbplho6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"svukskjwdhoqegbplho6","width":396,"height":380}},{"id":37717,"name":"Coryoon","slug":"coryoon","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/coryoon","created_at":1497875755953,"updated_at":1513023811135,"summary":"A horizontal shoot 'em up that casts you as a baby dragon out to free a princess from the clutches of an evil....well, you get the idea.

The player and the AI-controlled rival kingdoms select actions that include diplomacy, combat and domestic matters such as farming and trade, with the ultimate goal being to wrest control over the rest of China from the other two kingdoms. \n \nThe game was followed up with two sequels: a standard sequel in Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi II and the board game spin-off Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi Bangi.","collection":3664,"popularity":1.0,"games":[18623,23345,29173,55590,6985,26391,19934,55036,9199,19376],"tags":[17,22,268435469,268435471,536871063,536872060,536874694,536875053,536875067,536876056],"category":0,"keywords":[151,1148,3782,4141,4155,5144],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":709516800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":709516800000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jun-26","y":1992,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":712108800000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jul-26","y":1992,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ud1ddzehmitebgva0sf2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ud1ddzehmitebgva0sf2","width":500,"height":902}},{"id":37760,"name":"YamYam","slug":"yamyam","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yamyam","created_at":1497877162117,"updated_at":1516640465367,"summary":"A young boy called Magu Magu travels across the world with his friend: a giant light pink flightless bird called Yam Yam.

Shikkari Shinasai: Taisen Puzzle-dama (ツヨシしっかりしなさい 対戦ぱずるだま Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai: Taisen Pazurudama?) is a Taisen Puzzle-Dama video game based on the manga Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai. It was developed and published by Konami, and was released exclusively in Japan in 1994, for the Super Famicom. \n \nIt features the cast of the manga and anime Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai (usually localized as \"Hang in There, Tsuyoshi\") and Konami's own spin on Puyo Puyo: Taisen Puzzle-Dama (\"Battle Puzzle Ball\"). The goal of the game is to compete with a series of characters from Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai depending on who the player selected. \n \nPlay involves stacking duos of faces of various colors. If the player completes a set of three faces - they don't have to be lined up, but they do need to be adjacent - the faces disappear. If they are next to a \"trapped\" face it is transformed into a normal face block. Ideally, the player completes a three-strong stack of identical-colored trapped faces and frees them in groups of three, which will then lead to a chain as those three vanish and free more trapped faces. \n \nThe game was the first home console version of Konami's Taisen Puzzle-Dama series and the second game overall. The first version was the Arcade game Taisen Puzzle-Dama released earlier the same year. Future Taisen Puzzle-Dama games would also similarly feature anime license tie-ins, as well as characters from Konami's other properties.","collection":3939,"popularity":1.0,"games":[25222,60044,8197,14047,26223,70861,22481,69329,27266,39646],"tags":[268435465,536870990,536873787,536875053,536875379],"category":0,"keywords":[78,2875,4141,4467],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":785116800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":785116800000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Nov-18","y":1994,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":787708800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Dec-18","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b0f4qcospgj7me2zupcx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b0f4qcospgj7me2zupcx","width":339,"height":609}},{"id":37779,"name":"Tsuri Tarou","slug":"tsuri-tarou","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tsuri-tarou","created_at":1497877412655,"updated_at":1516768590053,"summary":"Tsuri Tarou is a Sports game, published by Pack-In-Video, which was released in Japan in 1994.","popularity":1.0,"games":[42241,37977,33988,37087,20513,65308,60650,43922,43286,42243],"tags":[268435470,536871421,536872928,536875181,536875352],"category":0,"keywords":[509,2016,4269,4440],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":776304000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":776304000000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Aug-08","y":1994,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d5hinelbj1zfc3yanpdv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d5hinelbj1zfc3yanpdv","width":550,"height":301}},{"id":37780,"name":"Tsuppari Oozumou: Risshin Shusse-hen","slug":"tsuppari-oozumou-risshin-shusse-hen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tsuppari-oozumou-risshin-shusse-hen","created_at":1497877414535,"updated_at":1516716949071,"summary":"Tsuppari Oozumou: Risshin Shusse-hen is a Sports game, developed and published by Tecmo, which was released in Japan in 1993.","collection":3619,"popularity":1.0,"games":[22690,62527,44383,6089,54662,37857,15851,11253,81281,80876],"tags":[268435470,536870973,536872078,536875353],"category":0,"keywords":[61,1166,4441],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":733104000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":733104000000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Mar-26","y":1993,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":735782400000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Apr-26","y":1993,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e5lynoysivkggnrspumg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e5lynoysivkggnrspumg","width":585,"height":1030}},{"id":37781,"name":"Tsukikomori","slug":"tsukikomori","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tsukikomori","created_at":1497877416594,"updated_at":1500609729087,"summary":"Tsukikomori is an Adventure game, developed by Pandora Box and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1996.","popularity":1.0,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":828316800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":828316800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Apr-01","y":1996,"m":4}]},{"id":37782,"name":"Traverse: Starlight \u0026 Prairie","slug":"traverse-starlight-and-prairie","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/traverse-starlight-and-prairie","created_at":1497877419088,"updated_at":1516748813909,"summary":"Traverse: Starlight \u0026 Prairie is a Role-Playing game, developed by Pandora Box and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1996.","popularity":1.0,"games":[12632,26766,36926,18398,36534,19698,64061,68393,47823,55092],"tags":[268435468,536871208,536871938,536872371,536878243],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,1459,7331],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":838512000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":838512000000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Jul-28","y":1996,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eao188w0gdjnygpqrkdu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eao188w0gdjnygpqrkdu","width":398,"height":215}},{"id":37783,"name":"Tottemo!

The Arcade version is sometimes referred to as \"Last Fortress\". \n \nThe player must clear all the tiles on the screen, as per usual mahjong solitaire rules, but in order to do so they have to store matching tiles along the bottom of the screen. The player's \"hand\" has a limited number of slots available, and if the player fills it up with pieces that don't match then they have failed. There is also a timer for the whole round that ticks down whenever the player is deliberating on their next move, and removing pairs of pieces from play will slightly refill it. There are also special power-up tiles that increase the timer. \n \nAs with mahjong solitaire, the player can only match identical tiles.

Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux (す～ぱ～なぞぷよ ルルーのルー, Sūpā Nazo Puyo Rurū No Rū) is the sequel to Nazo Puyo: Arle no Roux. It was succeeded by Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki. A Nuisance Puyo variation known as Iron Puyo was introduced in this game. \n \nSuper Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux uses the basic rules of Puyo Puyo. The game controls like a normal Puyo Puyo game with all five colors available and the ability to roate clockwise and counter clockwise, except the ability to double rotate and climb is not possible. Each puzzle gives the player different objectives to clear. The objectives range from clearing all of a specific color of Puyo, clearing all Nuisance Puyo, creating a specific chain length, clearing a certain amount of Puyo simultaneously, or simply clear the whole board. Every time the player fails to complete a puzzle, the player's health will deplete, as indicated by Arle or Rulue's expression gradually getting more distressed. If the player's health depletes completely, they'll receive a Game Over and can either choose to continue from the last save or quit back to the title. The player can recover completely if the gauges on the right side of the screen fills completely and rank up, with each cleared puzzle filling it gradually. On the pause menu, the player has the option to skip a puzzle at the cost of health. \n \nThere are five game modes: Arle's Roux, Rulue's Roux, Road to Chains, Endless Puyo, and Editor. In the first three modes, the player must solve the presented tasks with a set of available Puyo. Arle's Roux focuses on a scenario with Arle, acting as the normal course with her puzzles only involving standard Puyo. Rulue's Roux is the mode that focuses on Rulue and acts as the expert mode, with her puzzles including Iron Puyo and Blocks. In both modes, the objective is to clear puzzle sets from varies characters within an area, with one character acting as a boss that cannot be challenged until the others are beaten. Once the boss of a given area is beaten, the player will progress to the next area. Road to Chains acts as a challenge mode where the player is given a series of puzzles to solve at a gradually increasing difficulty, with the player being unable to restore health. \n \nThe Endless Puyo mode is a regular endless mode except that 6 next Puyo are shown instead of 1 next Puyo, and that nuisance Puyo will fall in the higher levels of difficulty. The Editor mode allows you to place Puyo freely in a manner similar to Practice Notebook in Puyo Puyo 7. You can also set a list of next Puyo and the task to be solved.","collection":3350,"popularity":1.0,"games":[12632,36926,26223,27209,68324,25222,25646,29147,47823,26766],"tags":[1,268435465,536871208,536871938,536873787,536875181,536879119],"publishers":[1215],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,2875,4269,8207],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":804124800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":804124800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jun-26","y":1995,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super

clothing store for a certain amount of yen per purchase. Interaction with non-player characters is possible while at the shopping district. Players can also gamble by placing wagers on other bicycle racing events,[5] buying parimutuel tickets with the chance of winning a respectable sum. Acquiring a newspaper to pick up results from other races can be done within the downtown portion of the game. \n \nThere are nine competitors and five laps in a typical race. Every track that can be raced on using a bicycle is an velodrome with four superelevated turns that are typical in most velodromes. Riders are not always traveling at full speed or at a specific radius; making a balance between aggressive riding and passive riding a must. All information for particular races are viewable on an information bank that is included with the racing action. Players must choose between story and party modes that provide a different perspective of the bicycle racing lifestyle.","popularity":1.0,"games":[40470,44242,54789,54662,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,37913],"tags":[268435466,268435469,268435470,536871641,536872060,536872078,536872712,536875069],"category":0,"keywords":[729,1148,1166,1800,4157],"genres":[10,13,14],"first_release_date":808358400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":808358400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Aug-14","y":1995,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n6pkxzxkxhpvrvednyn1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n6pkxzxkxhpvrvednyn1","width":818,"height":1486}},{"id":37821,"name":"Super Keiba 2","slug":"super-keiba-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-keiba-2","created_at":1497878240123,"updated_at":1516636937800,"summary":"Super Keiba 2 is a Sports game, developed by Tomcat System and published by I'Max, which was released in Japan in 1995.","popularity":1.0,"games":[40470,54789,29173,55689,55590,44242,54662,18623,11679,9199],"tags":[268435466,268435469,268435470,536871735,536871906,536872060,536875069],"category":0,"keywords":[823,994,1148,4157],"genres":[10,13,14],"first_release_date":771984000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":800841600000,"region":5,"human":"1995-May-19","y":1995,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":771984000000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Jun-19","y":1994,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cgvuxhl5oss7kh7kkawn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cgvuxhl5oss7kh7kkawn","width":302,"height":550}},{"id":37822,"name":"Super Keiba","slug":"super-keiba","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-keiba","created_at":1497878242116,"updated_at":1516697409085,"summary":"Super Keiba is a Sports game, published by I'Max, which was released in Japan in 1993.","popularity":1.0,"games":[40470,54789,29173,55689,55590,44242,54662,18623,11679,37818],"tags":[268435466,268435469,268435470,536871535,536871906,536872060,536874345,536875069],"category":0,"keywords":[623,994,1148,3433,4157],"genres":[10,13,14],"first_release_date":744940800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":744940800000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Aug-10","y":1993,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":747619200000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Sep-10","y":1993,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jeqms2q8armyrnfnvezi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jeqms2q8armyrnfnvezi","width":335,"height":600}},{"id":37823,"name":"Super Jinsei Game 3","slug":"super-jinsei-game-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-jinsei-game-3","created_at":1497878243826,"updated_at":1516621861467,"summary":"Super Jinsei Game 3 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Kid and published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 1996.","collection":3506,"popularity":1.0,"games":[11588,19083,28213,25217,37824,19082,44415,37810,37799,16439],"tags":[268435471,268435482,536872273,536873513,536875051,536875181],"category":0,"keywords":[1361,2601,4139,4269],"genres":[15,26],"first_release_date":849225600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":849225600000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Nov-29","y":1996,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":851817600000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Dec-29","y":1996,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fihod19coyqo1iiaahwn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fihod19coyqo1iiaahwn","width":2202,"height":1239}},{"id":37824,"name":"Super Jinsei Game 2","slug":"super-jinsei-game-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-jinsei-game-2","created_at":1497878246867,"updated_at":1516631772938,"summary":"Super Jinsei Game 2 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Kid and published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 1995.","collection":3506,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11588,19083,28213,25217,37823,16439,19082,49720,41225,37923],"tags":[268435471,268435482,536872273,536873513,536875051],"category":0,"keywords":[1361,2601,4139],"genres":[15,26],"first_release_date":810518400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":810518400000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Sep-08","y":1995,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":813110400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Oct-08","y":1995,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nqr3dqr0g1j73ejzce3z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nqr3dqr0g1j73ejzce3z","width":542,"height":300}},{"id":37825,"name":"Super Jinsei Game","slug":"super-jinsei-game","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-jinsei-game","created_at":1497878248132,"updated_at":1516675561635,"summary":"Super Jinsei Game is a video game adaptation of Milton Bradley's The Game of Life board game.

Jack and Ryu are now travelling between different planets to defeat some alien invaders, who kidnapped the world leaders. The battle system was also greatly improved. Jack and Ryu now have a lot of new attacks and even a few different skills (although they still share levels and items), they can turn into giant ninjas in order to cast the most advanced spells and it is possible to use weapons or spells without going to the menu. A fighting mode has also been added, allowing to play with many other characters than the heroes.","collection":2530,"popularity":1.0,"games":[55752,19333,10039,36926,26766,47823,19698,12632,19174,29147],"tags":[268435460,268435464,268435468,268435481,536870973,536871019,536871208,536871894,536872961,536873024,536873833,536874834,536875073,536875075,536875286],"category":0,"keywords":[61,107,296,982,2049,2112,2921,3922,4161,4163,4374],"genres":[4,8,12,25],"first_release_date":754012800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":754012800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Nov-23","y":1993,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Galactic

It is a spin-off of the Hebereke series, as well as Sunsoft's first attempt in the genre before they became better known for the 1995 Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors, the 1996 Waku Waku 7, and the 1998 Astra Super Stars. \n \nSugoi Hebereke is Bird's Eye-viewed like Vectorbeam's 1979 arcade game Warrior, but with brawling elements similar to the ones found in Atari Games' 1990 Pit-Fighter arcade, Technōs Japan's 1992 Nekketsu Kakutō Densetsu, Namco's 1994 The Outfoxies, and Nintendo's 1999 Super Smash Bros. There are two play modes in the game: story mode and VS. mode. In VS. mode, up to four players can play as the cast of the Hebereke series simultaneously when using an SNES Multitap. The object of the game is to knock out (KO) the other three opponents. Each stage is square shaped and has its own environmental hazards and moving objects.","collection":3905,"popularity":1.0,"games":[68324,56987,10039,1235,41828,47823,12632,41819,22418,36926],"tags":[1,268435460,536871019,536871208,536876804],"category":0,"keywords":[107,296,5892],"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":766022400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":766022400000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Apr-11","y":1994,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zrym085ylcvybwdutuy0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zrym085ylcvybwdutuy0","width":274,"height":500}},{"id":37847,"name":"Jikkyou Keiba Simulation: Stable Star","slug":"jikkyou-keiba-simulation-stable-star","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jikkyou-keiba-simulation-stable-star","created_at":1497878396809,"updated_at":1515779667830,"summary":"Jikkyou Keiba Simulation: Stable Star is a Sports game, developed by KCEO and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1996.","popularity":1.0,"games":[40470,54789,29173,54662,55590,55689,44242,11679,18623,22470],"tags":[268435466,268435469,268435470,536871735,536871906,536872060,536872078,536874345,536875069],"category":0,"keywords":[823,994,1148,1166,3433,4157],"genres":[10,13,14],"first_release_date":830131200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":830131200000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Apr-22","y":1996,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f0cqmg2mxi1foxogetij.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f0cqmg2mxi1foxogetij","width":238,"height":431}},{"id":37848,"name":"St Andrews: Eikou to Rekishi no Old Course","slug":"st-andrews-eikou-to-rekishi-no-old-course","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/st-andrews-eikou-to-rekishi-no-old-course","created_at":1497878398843,"updated_at":1516733944037,"summary":"St Andrews: Eikou to Rekishi no Old Course is a Sports game, published by Epoch, which was released in Japan in 1995.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6685,37932,61239,60294,48340,48144,41429,40292,35626,18101],"tags":[268435470,536870942,536873274,536875054,536875140,536875361,536875626,536875627,536875824],"category":0,"keywords":[30,2362,4142,4228,4449,4714,4715,4912],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":811123200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":811123200000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Sep-15","y":1995,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":813715200000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Oct-15","y":1995,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o3monkdglualmautr4mp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o3monkdglualmautr4mp","width":521,"height":937}},{"id":37849,"name":"Sprinter Monogatari","slug":"sprinter-monogatari","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sprinter-monogatari","created_at":1497878401036,"updated_at":1516781791567,"summary":"Sprinter Monogatari is a Sports game, developed and published by Vap, which was released in Japan in 1995.","popularity":1.0,"games":[40470,44242,54789,18623,22470,29173,26145,25443,22425,55689],"tags":[268435466,268435469,268435470,536872060,536872712,536875069],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,1800,4157],"genres":[10,13,14],"first_release_date":798076800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":798076800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Apr-17","y":1995,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Sprinter Monogatari ~Mezase!!

The goal is to make the most money and/or bankrupt the opponents. \n \nThe game is the third in the Okuman Chouja series, though the only one to be released on the Super Famicom.","collection":3494,"popularity":1.0,"games":[29173,19083,55036,11588,55590,9199,28213,19847,23345,25217],"tags":[268435471,268435482,536871906,536873513,536874694,536875051,536875181],"category":0,"keywords":[994,2601,3782,4139,4269],"genres":[15,26],"first_release_date":819763200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":819763200000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Dec-24","y":1995,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qskozwqgfd3wfrrd73vw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qskozwqgfd3wfrrd73vw","width":595,"height":323}},{"id":37859,"name":"Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 4: Kiso Kenkyu Hen","slug":"super-nichibutsu-mahjong-4-kiso-kenkyu-hen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-nichibutsu-mahjong-4-kiso-kenkyu-hen","created_at":1497879312291,"updated_at":1516593949875,"summary":"Super Nichibutsu Mahjong 4: Kiso Kenkyu Hen is a Miscellaneous game, published by Nichibutsu, which was released in Japan in 1996.","collection":3093,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11588,25217,19083,48788,48768,42423,38368,37938,37875,37811],"tags":[268435470,268435482,536871923,536873513,536875051],"category":0,"keywords":[1011,2601,4139],"genres":[14,26],"first_release_date":843782400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":843782400000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Sep-27","y":1996,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":846374400000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Oct-27","y":1996,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d0do5grsknmltde3kpqk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d0do5grsknmltde3kpqk","width":238,"height":426}},{"id":37860,"name":"Sanrio Shanghai","slug":"sanrio-shanghai","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sanrio-shanghai","created_at":1497879313684,"updated_at":1516670696012,"summary":"Sanrio Shanghai is a Puzzle game, developed by SAS Sakata and published by Character Soft, which was released in Japan in 1994.","collection":3283,"popularity":1.0,"games":[25222,60044,26223,14047,27266,64658,8197,18167,54678,25646],"tags":[268435465,536871581,536873787,536875054,536875082,536875241,536876709],"category":0,"keywords":[669,2875,4142,4170,4329,5797],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":778291200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":778291200000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Aug-31","y":1994,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":780969600000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Oct-01","y":1994,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tdlvehms5twxymsk2kwy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tdlvehms5twxymsk2kwy","width":640,"height":350}},{"id":37861,"name":"Sankyo Fever!

The player emerges in the middle of Tokyo's Akihabara district where the buildings have turned into ruins. Countless demons have managed to destroy cities everywhere and the people are all hiding underground. Getting home to the Shinjuku district will allow the player to uncover more of the plot. Mysterious artificats called ooparts (out-of-place artifacts) help to play a role in this invasion by a mysterious civilization. \n \nPlayers must choose between five characters; each one having different strengths and limitations. The game is played from the first-person perspective and the battles are extremely random. The dungeons in the game are claustrophobic and should remind some games of Shin Megami Tensei. Players do not gain levels after earning so many experience points. Instead, they gain energy points to boost their statistics.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,25300,13189,11296,27314,19448,44076,11567,36950,54842],"tags":[18,19,268435468,268435487,536870981,536871015,536871882,536871938,536871939,536872032,536872120,536872425,536874398,536875160,536875198,536875242,536876316,536877554],"category":0,"keywords":[69,103,970,1026,1027,1120,1208,1513,3486,4248,4286,4330,5404,6642],"themes":[18,19],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":817430400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":817430400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Nov-27","y":1995,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yweynrid5nlabcigq4ql.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yweynrid5nlabcigq4ql","width":328,"height":591}},{"id":37932,"name":"Masters

Instead of fighting \"girls\" (who vary in age, occupation, and appearance) in a random encounter, the player has to \"win\" their heart. Some of their \"special attacks\" includes the girls biting their nails and using their cosmetics.

It was designed by Toru Iwatani, who had also designed the Gee Bee series, Pac-Man, and Pole Position. It is a curious but challenging game, where the player tries to harvest little mushrooms (Mushlins) while avoiding various enemies, and was the first game from Namco to use a Motorola 68000 processor (which ran at 6.144 MHz). \n \nAt first glance, the gameplay resembles Taito's Qix. The player controls two \"arrows\", one red (Libble) and one blue (Rabble) with a line strung between them. The object is to wrap the line around poles and surround Mushlins and enemies with it. The player can either close the loops themselves (worth more points for the Mushlins) or move both arrows to the same edge of the screen. The player clears a \"season\" when he or she harvests all the Mushlins. \n \nAlong the way, various enemies will appear and try to stop the player. The most common are four little hooded critters (Hobblins), which start each season in the corners. If the player catches them in a loop, they will be sent to the top of the screen for a short period of time. Other critters such as fireballs (Killers), sparks (Changers), and Demons will also appear. These can be killed by closing a loop around them. Sometimes, scissors-like enemies (Shears) appear, and if they cross the player's line, they cut it. If the player's line is ever cut by Shears or Demons, a new one is instantly made: directly between the two arrows. \n \nEvery so often when the player closes a line, a detector goes off indicating that the area he or she has closed off has a treasure chest somewhere. To actually uncover the chest, the player must surround a small enough area which covers just the chest, and no other possible hiding places. The game guides the player along that step, first by challenging him or her to uncover a chest at the start of the game (and then by revealing the locations of the chests for the first two seasons). When the player actually uncovers a chest, six bonus creatures (Topcups) will pop out, then make for the edges. The player must corral them with his or her line and then close the loop to score the bonus for them: they mean bonus letters. If the player manages to complete a bonus word, the season is automatically cleared out and the player moves to a bonus stage where he or she must try to uncover and collect chests (to collect a chest, the player needs to close a loop around an opened chest) within a time limit. \n \nThe player loses a life if any of the assorted critters touch one of the arrows or if he or she runs out of time (the border is the player's timer, and he or she can boost the time by looping Mushlins and plants), and the player gains an extra life at 40,000, 120,000, 200,000, 400,000, 600,000 and 1,000,000 points by default. After the 100th season, the season counter will stop at 99, similar to how Galaxian and King \u0026 Balloon's round indicators would stop after 48 rounds.","collection":3578,"popularity":1.0,"games":[68324,76110,47823,12632,55092,22747,36608,34919,36926,27209],"tags":[1,536871208,536875046,536875181],"category":0,"keywords":[296,4134,4269],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":782784000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":782784000000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Oct-22","y":1994,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e9ehp4wfxxlwyojkxqxz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e9ehp4wfxxlwyojkxqxz","width":600,"height":1065}},{"id":37946,"name":"Super Uno","slug":"super-uno","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-uno","created_at":1497880822245,"updated_at":1516697865134,"summary":"Super Uno is the video game adaptation of the card game of the same name.

Simply flying a ship into outer space simply wasn't going to cut it anymore. Taito had an idea. Yes, there was still a spaceship. And yeah, that \"outer space\" part was still there too. But instead of the usual aliens, you fought fish. \n \nYes, fish. \n \nNot even regular, aquatic fish, but robotic fish with lasers equipped to their fins, giant metal teeth and missiles firing from their gills. And not just fish either. There are squid, snails, and other undersea variations out for your blood as well. \n \nThe requisite plot is about the people of the planet Darius, who are being terrorized by said intergalatic fish. Only the heroic pilots Proco Jr and Tiat Young can save the day. The constant star of the Darius series is the Silver Hawk. Much like Gradius, it has a primary, forward firing weapon, along with bombs that can be used to attack vertically, and the usual shield. \n \nThe arcade game Darius games also used a unique system that attached three monitors together to create one massive horizontal playing field (also used in Taito's Ninja Warriors.) Naturally, this couldn't quite be replicated on the console system, so that nifty little gimmick is lost, but emulators can still replicate the dimensions of the screen, even if you end up looking at a tiny picture. \n \nLooking to further set itself apart from the crowd, every Darius game has multiple levels, with several branching paths throughout the game. It adds tremendously to the replay value, especially since there are usual multiple endings, depending on which final zone you end up at. \n \nDarius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen was three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet used an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run. \n \nWhen various ports of it were made for different consoles, Taito (and others) were forced to shrink the playfield to fit on one screen. \n \nIt was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, PC Engine, PC Engine (Super CD-ROM), Wii (Virtual Console), and ZX Spectrum. \n \nThe PC Engine saw three releases: \n \nDarius Alpha (1990): A very rare beta release. This is one of the rarest Hu-Cards ever published. You could only get a copy of this hardcore shoot-em-up by buying Darius Plus and Super Darius and then mailing coupons to the publisher. 800 copies were made available, and names were drawn from those who mailed their info in. Some copies of the game were also given away as prizes by PC Engine Gekken and Marakatsu magazines. \n \nDarius Plus (1990): The full game itself, again a PC Engine HuCard. The bosses that were removed in Alpha do not return here. Both Alpha and Plus were actually written for the PC Engine SuperGrafx and playing them on that console results in slightly improved graphics (less flicker and slowdown). \n \nSuper Darius (1990): A conversion of Darius for the PC Engine's Super CD-ROM, very close to the original arcade version other than being single-screen. Features new bosses, as well as a \"boss rush\" mode.","collection":2083,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[68287,36950,27314,21250,3075,6840,1489,2751,6007,47206],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871470,536871859,536871882,536871971,536872651,536873021,536873064,536874398,536874743,536875075,536875200,536875232,536875309,536875396,536875870,536875872,536875941,536876028,536876120,536876518,536876575,536876633,536876634,536876635,536876713,536876845,536877435,536880077,536880078,536880079,536880080],"category":0,"keywords":[166,558,947,970,1059,1739,2109,2152,3486,3831,4163,4288,4320,4397,4484,4958,4960,5029,5116,5208,5606,5663,5721,5722,5723,5801,5933,6523,9165,9166,9167,9168],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[63,86,16],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":63,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989-Dec-31","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989-Dec-31","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":640224000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Apr-16","y":1990,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w6fn2hkfgjd48hmuwlyf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w6fn2hkfgjd48hmuwlyf","width":800,"height":1048}},{"id":38079,"name":"Strip Fighter II","slug":"strip-fighter-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/strip-fighter-ii","created_at":1497950508177,"updated_at":1513005728253,"summary":"Six fighters from around the world fight for supremacy and the prestige of being the strongest and sexiest fighter ever to grace the arena.

Originally released for the Super Famicom, it was released on the Japanese Virtual Console in 2007 and a mobile phone in 2008 by G-Mode. \n \nThe game's plot and setting are loosely based around various episodes included in Greek mythology. The hero begins the game in a state of total memory-loss, but discovers that he has somehow acquired a mysterious power that shields him from all bodily harm, essentially making him immortal. The only clue the hero has in discovering his own identity is a mysterious dream that he sees every night, and he begins his journey in search of the location shown in the dream. \n \nThe gameplay borrows various motifs from ancient mythology, particularly the concept of immortality. An immortal character can execute certain actions that other characters cannot, like jumping off high cliffs without being injured. The game's writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a storyline where the hero encounters the Greek gods while trying to discover his own true identity. Like the game's predecessor, Heracles no Eikō II: Titan no Metsubō, the game focuses on its rich storyline rather than the game system, which does not differ significantly from other role-playing video games of the period.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":706665600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":706665600000,"region":8,"human":"1992-May-24","y":1992,"m":5}]},{"id":38258,"name":"Flying Hero: Bugyuru's Adventure","slug":"flying-hero-bugyurus-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/flying-hero-bugyurus-adventure","created_at":1497958768643,"updated_at":1500602307366,"summary":"Flying Hero: Bugyuru no Daibouken (\"Bugyuru's Great Adventure\") is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up with a bright, cartoony style, similar to games like Sega's Fantasy Zone or Konami's TwinBee series.

After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies. \n \nBy default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the \"down\" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc. \n \nThe bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.","franchise":755,"franchises":[755],"popularity":2.666666666666667,"games":[37419,31712,57372,81249,78632,62890,80916,76747,75540,59937],"tags":[1,268435487,536870990,536874038],"publishers":[11162],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,3126],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":727315200000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":727315200000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Jan-18","y":1993,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon"},{"name":"美少女戦士セーラームーン","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cmgms5opynjnrdf6291y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cmgms5opynjnrdf6291y","width":200,"height":180},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/skujwmszzay0z7m1td1l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"skujwmszzay0z7m1td1l","width":200,"height":180},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ctenb0i3wcak185z7dks.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ctenb0i3wcak185z7dks","width":200,"height":180}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dqfgq094yxd818qpayvo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dqfgq094yxd818qpayvo","width":220,"height":253},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_(Game_Boy)"}]},{"id":38280,"name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon","slug":"bishoujo-senshi-sailor-moon--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bishoujo-senshi-sailor-moon--1","created_at":1497959098731,"updated_at":1536005473985,"collection":3094,"franchise":755,"franchises":[755],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741828],"developers":[11162,1218],"publishers":[13886,617,11162],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[17],"genres":[25,33],"first_release_date":746409600000,"platforms":[29,19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":773625600000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Jul-08","y":1994,"m":7},{"category":2,"platform":19,"date":788832000000,"region":1,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":746409600000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Aug-27","y":1993,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Sailor Moon","comment":"French title"},{"name":"美少女戦士セーラームーン","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon","comment":"Japanese title"}]},{"id":38281,"name":"Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '95: Tokyo Dome Battle","slug":"shin-nippon-pro-wrestling-95-tokyo-dome-battle","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shin-nippon-pro-wrestling-95-tokyo-dome-battle","created_at":1497959108607,"updated_at":1500601982590,"summary":"The Super Juniors invade the Super Famicom!

Like in actual wrestling, rope breaks can be ordered by the referee. \n \nThis game features genuine female professional wrestlers from All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling; unlike the non-Joshi Fire Pro games which featured carbon copies with false names. Bull Nakano and Akira Hokuto can be unlocked for completing the challenge mode. While lacking in a proper story line, players can choose from a variety of gimmick matches.","collection":903,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6685,38284,6051,36587,38408,38436,38276,6734,6408,3626],"tags":[268435460,268435470,536871146,536875183,536875190,536875472,536875716,536879181],"category":0,"keywords":[234,4271,4278,4560,4804,8269],"genres":[4,14],"first_release_date":807062400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":807062400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jul-30","y":1995,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/umuojecechtgkkotknnm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"umuojecechtgkkotknnm","width":225,"height":405}},{"id":38283,"name":"Super Fire Pro Wrestling","slug":"super-fire-pro-wrestling","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-fire-pro-wrestling","created_at":1497959133509,"updated_at":1516723824745,"summary":"Fire Pro Wrestling has taken Japan by storm, and now it has come to the Super Famicom! 110 unique move are at your disposal, and this is the most realistic simulation of wrestling ever!","collection":903,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6685,67730,6051,38408,46028,42436,42338,38287,41828,38295],"tags":[268435460,268435470,536870973,536871146,536875075,536875138,536875140,536875361],"category":0,"keywords":[61,234,4163,4226,4228,4449],"genres":[4,14],"first_release_date":693187200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":693187200000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Dec-20","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":695865600000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jan-20","y":1992,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xhjbh9kai799z9adblim.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xhjbh9kai799z9adblim","width":224,"height":400}},{"id":38284,"name":"Super Fire Pro Wrestling 2","slug":"super-fire-pro-wrestling-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-fire-pro-wrestling-2","created_at":1497959137122,"updated_at":1516768628333,"summary":"The formula is the same, but the game has become much more powerful!

Stylistically similar to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, BS Zelda no Densetsu: Inishie no Sekiban is also occasionally regarded as an enhanced remake of this title.

Eight different players can become the captain of the player's team and the team can use one of five different formations (4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero). All of the formations are used in modern day soccer except for the WM formation (which saw common use in England during the 1930s). The star player (captain) chosen kicks a shot (super shot or hyper shot) that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands, just like in Hat Trick Hero. Exhibition, world league (similar to a World Cup tournament) and Taito Cup (24 teams to beat) are the three possible variations in the game. After beating all the 23 national teams in the Taito cup mode, there is a final game against a team with the abbreviation \"NLC\".

The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it. \n \nPlayers must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles. \n \nSeveral power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon. \n \nIn addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players. As the player progresses, the amount of bubbles required to reach the next level also increases, similar to scoring on Tetris.","popularity":1.0,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super Buster Bros.

Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot, to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters are:Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis. \n \nCatalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas. \n \nPietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt. \n \nErnst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream. \n \nAli Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods... \n \nOtto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet. Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in the name of King and Country.Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents. Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings, each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other ships. \n \nDuring naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[86605,34000,11362,9760,51906,33603,55737,33707,33383,36962],"tags":[268435471],"publishers":[630],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[41,19,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1385683200000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Nov-29","y":2013,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1383091200000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Oct-30","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1384387200000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Nov-14","y":2013,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1237248000000,"region":5,"human":"2009-Mar-17","y":2009,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1238976000000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Apr-06","y":2009,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kqnywbt6guxx7wcc5j1u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kqnywbt6guxx7wcc5j1u","width":256,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lrinp05ovk4ok02bd1u9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lrinp05ovk4ok02bd1u9","width":256,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bueqrdeiywps7e5rmmyq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bueqrdeiywps7e5rmmyq","width":256,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w8yuglygqozwxv1vgtdp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w8yuglygqozwxv1vgtdp","width":256,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8y9oariqmxgjptgpgpg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s8y9oariqmxgjptgpgpg","width":256,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vh6wabajdsqacemrgcqv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vh6wabajdsqacemrgcqv","width":256,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u0dukckpaajtbiku0ggz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u0dukckpaajtbiku0ggz","width":256,"height":224}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/awiconjikdrl6bcyyjnj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"awiconjikdrl6bcyyjnj","width":521,"height":361}},{"id":38413,"name":"Ultimate Fighter","slug":"ultimate-fighter","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-fighter","created_at":1497964834358,"updated_at":1500596945544,"summary":"Get ready for furious fighting action with ULTIMATE FIGHTER!

Godzilla is led to Osaka, where he fights and kills King Ghidorah. Immediately afterwards, Ghidorah's body vanishes and an alien spaceship appears. The invaders reveal that they were controlling Ghidorah, and demand that the human race surrender. Meanwhile, another Godzilla appears in Mt. Fuji, and the Super X II lures the real Godzilla there to fight it. Godzilla confronts the new Godzilla, who is revealed to be Mechagodzilla wearing an artificial skin. During Godzilla's fight with the robot, the aliens kidnap Dr. Shiragami and take him to Lake Ashino. Godzilla goes there to rescue the professor, and is confronted by Biollante, his plant-like clone. After defeating Biollante, the Super X II rescues Shiragami, it is revealed that the doctor had recovered DNA samples of Godzilla and King Ghidorah and had been experimenting on them to create a serum that enhances the physical attributes of any being. However, the aliens invaded his laboratory and stole the samples, using them to create Biollante. \n \nDr. Shiragami injects some of the serum into Godzilla, making him stronger. The aliens unleash Battra in Yokohama, and it lays an egg that is threatening to hatch. Godzilla travels to Yokohama, kills Battra, and destroys the egg before it can hatch. King Ghidorah soon returns as Mecha-King Ghidorah, having been resurrected by the aliens, and begins to attack Yokohama. The aliens reveal that they have hidden several capsules around the city that are holding Shiragami's serum. If Godzilla can find them all before Mecha-King Ghidorah destroys fifty percent of the city, he will mutate into a more powerful form. He succeeds, and confronts Mecha-King Ghidorah. The cyborg monster is easily outmatched by Godzilla's newfound power and is destroyed. However, the battle is far from over. The aliens travel to China, where they awaken an ancient creature called Bagan and inject him with sample of the serum, making him just as powerful as Godzilla. The two titans battle in the ruins of Yokohama, and Bagan proves to be more challenging than all the other monsters he faced. Eventually, Godzilla bests Bagan, and the aliens retreat, but not before promising revenge. The serum eventually wears off, and Godzilla returns to his original form. The Super X II disables the transmitter, releasing Godzilla from their control, and the mutant dinosaur returns to the ocean with humanity indebted to him for his aide.","collection":3301,"franchise":205,"franchises":[205],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[54996,34823,13200,27092,61985,37066,11582,1877,36950,27011],"tags":[1,18,268435460,268435471,536870979,536871019,536871079,536871213,536871644,536871882,536871972,536872211,536872257,536873874,536874694,536874743,536874745,536875054,536875056,536875197,536875539,536875717,536875755,536875944,536877048,536881427],"developers":[13549],"publishers":[3920],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[67,107,167,301,732,970,1060,1299,1345,2962,3782,3831,3833,4142,4144,4285,4627,4805,4843,5032,6136,10515],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4,15],"first_release_date":756604800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":756604800000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Dec-23","y":1993,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Chou-Godzilla","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Chō-Gojira","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"超ゴジラ","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ylvjj18lf3hngchjwbxq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ylvjj18lf3hngchjwbxq","width":600,"height":835}},{"id":38419,"name":"Super Goal! 2","slug":"super-goal-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-goal-2","created_at":1497965186288,"updated_at":1515824244812,"summary":"Super Goal! 2 is a soccer game with the two game modes: Tournament and Exhibition, that can support two simultaneous players for one on one action, and has 20 International teams to choose from including Germany, Brazil, Argentina and U.S.A. just to name a few along with players modeled after their real-life counterparts. \n \nPlayers can customize each game to their liking including rule set-ups, stadiums, team formations and including the soccer ball design.

We intended to deliver these words somewhat earlier, back when we covered Football Manager Handheld. Both games are, after all, football management sims based on popular PC forebears and revised for PSP, both were released around the same time, and indeed we started our reviewing in tandem. \n \nIt's just that Championship Manager 2006 has taken a little bit longer. \n \nThere are three reasons for this. The first is that, well, it's rather extensive. Whereas Football Manager Handheld opted for a cut-down, retro approach, Championship Manager 2006 goes the other way. It's every bit as huge as its PC parent, covering 55 leagues from the 12 leading footballing nations. \n \nGranted you can only play with the leagues of one country at a time, but each country has all the appropriate teams in all divisions, as well as reserve teams and youth squads. Each of the resultant 25,000 players has the usual mountain of statistics spread over five screens, detailing their skills, form and happiness, and they can all be trained, transfer-listed, praised or damned in the media, fined, demoted or promoted through the ranks, loaned or sold. \n \nThe transfer market is equally thorough, with a filtering system that enables you to search for specifically skilled players augmented by features like being able to scout or declare an interest in a player to unsettle them, and complex deals involving player-exchanges and sweeteners. With clubs negotiating deals or pulling out and media speculation and disgruntled footballers playing their part, Championship Manager 2006 feels real in a way that Football Manager Handheld didn't quite manage. \n \nThe matches themselves are equally involved affairs. There are six different ways to view the action, ranging from quick result to textual descriptions, possession bars, and a 2D match view complete with crowd sounds. \n \nThe latter is obviously the most tantalising attraction. When you're starting as a manager watching your charges (well, coloured circles) scurry around the pitch is even more hypnotic than viewing a mute pub TV, especially at the slowest speed. Combine this with more tactical options than Mourinho could ask for (custom formations, specific team and individual tactics, and even specific runs and passes for players to make) and you'll see how even pre-season friendlies can absorb hours. \n \nYou might also comprehend why it has taken us weeks of on-and-off play (and multiple recharges) to get through just a season. And though the more casual armchair manager might want to skip through things a little more rapidly (or even take advantage of the shorter Challenge mode), the faithful should be over the moon, Brian. \n \nSadly, the second reason for our delayed review – the interface – isn't as positive. At least ten per cent of our play time must have been frittered away getting to grips with it, and our first few attempts to navigate the hyperlink-strewn pages without a mouse were as frustrating as watching Lampard and Gerrard trying to play the same role in the England midfield. Whilst we did learn how to use shortcuts to ease this torment, the system (like Sven's formation) doesn't feel completely right. \n \nThe final reason for our tardiness? That's the trickiest. We've been reluctant to file our final review because we wanted to be sure how we felt. \n \nIn many ways, Championship Manager 2006 seems to have all the elements of a classic, but it just doesn't entirely convince us. \n \nPrincipally this is down to the match engine, which can feel like it's trying to recreate pinball rather than football. Stray passes, interceptions and the inability to beat players or shoot on target are all part of the real game, but the frequency of these events here in comparison to moments of flowing football are rather soul destroying. \n \nWorse, there's a distinct feeling that the result you get from watching a match is different to that from a quick result, with reported matches offering far more goals than games you play through. Extreme tactical tinkering can help alleviate the situation, but the base level of difficulty seems less forgiving than Alex Ferguson. \n \nAdd to this glitches such as substituted players seeming to reappear, goals being credited to the wrong player and the way certain teams (like Chelsea) seem unbeatable, and what could have been a life-consuming joy becomes an oddly addictive love-hate relationship, as your hopes are raised then dashed and still you come back for more (perhaps it should be called Football Fan Simulator?). \n \nUltimately, Championship Manager 2006 really is a game of two halves, one of which promises glory of Champions League proportions, while the other has a tendency to deliver conference fare. If next season's outing raises its game on the pitch, it really could be deserving of its 'championship' name. Right now, it remains a promising contender.","popularity":1.0,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1162339200000,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1162339200000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Nov-01","y":2006,"m":11}]},{"id":38460,"name":"Super Robot Wars MX Portable","slug":"super-robot-wars-mx-portable","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-robot-wars-mx-portable","created_at":1497967632991,"updated_at":1500583454262,"summary":"Another year, another PS2 SRW game.

Certain areas of the maze are colored green and purple, and the player will earn more points if the balloon and box pass through the area safely. While there is no time limit, the player cannot wait for a long time; otherwise, a face will appear and blow the balloon into the spikes. \nAs the player completes mazes, individual spikes, or even the entire maze, may begin moving or scrolling.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,36608,19222,34919,41348,40524,2969,23175,10225,16468],"tags":[1,268435465],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":318211200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":318211200000,"region":8,"human":"1980-Feb-01","y":1980,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pehrzalrymvfhjvwp7gr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pehrzalrymvfhjvwp7gr","width":850,"height":1195}},{"id":38533,"name":"Crude Buster","slug":"crude-buster","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crude-buster","created_at":1497974910722,"updated_at":1534013816065,"summary":"The year is 20XX.

The game was sold to Vectorbeam by Cinematronics.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,36608,34919,41552,18467,14139,55752,16468,37094,27266],"tags":[1,268435465,268435486,536871846,536875416],"category":0,"keywords":[934,4504],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,30],"first_release_date":255139200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":255139200000,"region":8,"human":"1978-Feb-01","y":1978,"m":2}]},{"id":38547,"name":"Bang","slug":"bang","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bang","created_at":1497975066378,"updated_at":1515667059354,"summary":"A cartoony first-person 2-D Wild West shooter from Gaelco.","collection":3941,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,55752,36868,7329,21063,25300,11156,73,27314],"tags":[1,18,27,268435461,268435464,536870926,536870990,536871113,536871213,536871262,536871859,536871882,536871937,536871938,536872961,536873299,536873973,536875057,536875073,536875209,536875271,536875395,536875819,536875941,536876211,536876353,536876377,536876633,536877806,536878102,536882169,536883622,536884033,536884863],"category":0,"keywords":[14,78,201,301,350,947,970,1025,1026,2049,2387,3061,4145,4161,4297,4359,4483,4907,5029,5299,5441,5465,5721,6894,7190,11257,12710,13121,13951],"themes":[1,18,27],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":886291200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":886291200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Feb-01","y":1998,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/weddceylwpup14s5fqv3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"weddceylwpup14s5fqv3","width":229,"height":224},"esrb":{"rating":5}},{"id":38548,"name":"Mirai Ninja","slug":"mirai-ninja","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mirai-ninja","created_at":1497975540091,"updated_at":1500235235840,"summary":"Mirai Ninja was based on a Japanese movie of the same name, also produced by Namco.

The flyer may give the impression that it uses an isometric perspective but it uses the same overhead view as the first six Pac-Man titles - and, the player must use a 4-directional joystick to take control of a yellow racer car (the eponymous \"Van-Van Car\"), which is on a mission to burst balloons with its front-mounted spike while watching out for the three \"killer\" cars (which are red, green, and blue, so the last one looks somewhat like an evil version of the car from Namco's Rally-X). \n \nEach normal balloon burst will be worth 200 points, regardless of colour; also, if you press that \"Jump Button\", Van-Van Car will jump into the air, and every time it jumps over one of the killer cars, you will receive 100 points.

Finally, Van-Van Car will start spinning around in a clockwise direction at twice its normal speed when it passes over an oil slick - and even though it loses its jump power, it will quickly be able to get away from the killer cars, especially when they are close behind it.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":38557,"name":"Video Hustler","slug":"video-hustler","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/video-hustler","created_at":1497975634006,"updated_at":1515814221561,"summary":"A pool game initially released by Konami in 1981 for the arcade.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,83375,40625,21401,54662,15851,63648,52246,47511,11253],"tags":[268435470,536872078,536872928,536876362],"category":0,"keywords":[1166,2016,5450],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":349833600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":349833600000,"region":8,"human":"1981-Feb-01","y":1981,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hjz1awoip4vc9qsi3uon.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hjz1awoip4vc9qsi3uon","width":850,"height":1195}},{"id":38558,"name":"Wiping","slug":"wiping","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wiping","created_at":1497975641443,"updated_at":1500235104156,"summary":"Wiping is a Maze / Digging game developed by Nichibutsu for the Arcade.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":38559,"name":"Wonder Momo","slug":"wonder-momo","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wonder-momo","created_at":1497975661445,"updated_at":1518020601056,"summary":"Wonder Momo is a loose parody of a typical Ultraman-style superhero series, and utilizing a then-rare female protagonist. When the game is first started, players are treated to a parody of the MGM logo featuring Momo instead of a lion and a \"Modoki\" instead of a mask. The game then cuts to a scene of a theater stage, where a play begins starring Momo, a young woman who gets super-powers. At this point the game puts the player in command of Momo. Rather than playing a hero who needs to save the world, the setting is that of a live stage show (set at the \"Namco Theater\"), and the player is actually controlling an actress who is merely playing the role of Momo/Wonder Momo. The game also features voice samples in Japanese. \n \nAs Momo, she can only attack using kicks, and in doing so builds up her \"Wonder\" meter. When she touches a tornado icon, or spins around by herself, she can turn into Wonder Momo and can also attack using the Wonder Hoop, which can be reused as long as she is Wonder Momo. After the Wonder Hoop is thrown, she won't be able to throw anymore, while she'll have to wait for it to bounce back to her. She can also shoot small waves of energy in whichever direction she faces (while she is crouching), which is based on the similar move by the Ultraman characters. Her most powerful attack is the Wonder Typhoon - a more powerful version of her small energy wave attack which shoots numerous amounts of small energy waves towards the left and right sides of the screen simultaneously, while she is spinning. \n \nThe game is notable for featuring some slightly risqué content for the time, in the form of fanservice (at Momo's expense). When Momo jumps, the player can visibly see her underwear. Momo also needs to be wary of photographers in the theatre audience, who are determined to get a peek under her miniskirt. If one is successful, Momo will get \"embarrassed\" (stunned) for a short period of time. Additionally, one of the images that appears on the theater curtain (at the beginning and end of some acts) is Momo wearing only a towel.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,1188,10039,36608,74863,1066,34919,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464],"publishers":[263],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":541555200000,"platforms":[52,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1172534400000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Feb-27","y":2007,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":541555200000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Mar-01","y":1987,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rfs0iwvnuysm8sxrcrc0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rfs0iwvnuysm8sxrcrc0","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yy63heglrtzrwdujwc48.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yy63heglrtzrwdujwc48","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vr10uzwwprw8lshqixwu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vr10uzwwprw8lshqixwu","width":344,"height":270},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ehbxuaqnt23dq2hwpflu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ehbxuaqnt23dq2hwpflu","width":516,"height":407}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q6pzk6pj0lrxyjlv2xpb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q6pzk6pj0lrxyjlv2xpb","width":379,"height":383}},{"id":38560,"name":"World Soccer Finals","slug":"world-soccer-finals","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/world-soccer-finals","created_at":1497975681064,"updated_at":1500235086229,"summary":"World Soccer Finals is a Coin-Operated Arcade Video Game produced by Leland in 1990. \nThis game ranks a 1 on a scale out of 100 (100 = most often seen, 1=least common) in popularity based on census ownership records. \nOther machines made by Leland during the time period World Soccer Finals was produced include Pig Out, Ataxx, Brute Force, Danny Sullivan's Indy Heat, Dragon's Lair II, Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road, Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off Road Track Pak, All American Football, Viper, and Strike Zone Baseball.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":646790400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":646790400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jul-01","y":1990,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uesyikbpf4z6pmqzw0q4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uesyikbpf4z6pmqzw0q4","width":850,"height":1097}},{"id":38561,"name":"Shoot Out","slug":"shoot-out","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shoot-out","created_at":1497975683277,"updated_at":1500235060679,"summary":"Player controls with two buttons and an 8-way joystick.

If the players lost a life during a stage, they would keep all the weapons they collected on the level, but once they beat the level they start the next one with default weaponry.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":631152000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":631152000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jan-01","y":1990,"m":1}]},{"id":38649,"name":"Ghost Muncher","slug":"ghost-muncher","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ghost-muncher","created_at":1497980597393,"updated_at":1500236887353,"summary":"This is Pac-Man/Puck-Man except the colors have been changed as have the sounds and the names of the ghosts.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":378691200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":378691200000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Jan-01","y":1982,"m":1}]},{"id":38650,"name":"Gorkans","slug":"gorkans","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gorkans","created_at":1497980601314,"updated_at":1500236878802,"summary":"Move along lines, erasing them as you go, to collect flashing or spinning items.

If the ball bounces into an area where there are no monsters to hit (such as behind a fallen apple), Mr. Do cannot use it again until he has retrieved it.

If the player continues shooting the bell after it appears, it will change into one of four other colors: the regular yellow bells only grant bonus points, the white bell will upgrade the player's gun into a twin cannon, the blue bell increases the player's speed (for up to five speed levels), the green bell will allow the player to create image copies of its ship for additional firepower, and the red bell will provide the player's ship a barrier that allows it to sustain more damage. The green and red bells cannot be combined together. Other power-ups can also be retrieved from ground enemies such as an alternate bell that gives the player's ship a three-way gun, a star which eliminates all on-screen enemies. \n \nAs with other games of the same genre, getting shot by a single enemy bullet will cause the player to lose a life. However, if the bullet only strikes either side of the ship instead, the player's ship will only lose one of its arms.

The dust and rock thrown up by the resulting explosion caused enormous climactic changes in the ensuing years, and many of the Earth's species became extinct during the long winter that followed. \n \nThe object itself was buried thousands of feet below ground, its nearly two kilometer length remarkably intact. It remained there, motionless, for thousands of years before it finally began to stir- and to dream. It was a member of a race whose history began when the Milky Way was still a formless collection of dust and gas- a powerful race of immortals which had quickly grown bored of their tiny universe and nearly exterminated themselves in war. \n \nThis particular being, whose name no human throat will ever learn to pronounce, was part of the cataclysmic battle that formed Magellanic Clouds, billions of years ago. It died there, or it came as close to dying as these things can, and drifted aimlessly for millions of light years before striking the Earth. \n \nThe heat of impact liquefied the rock around it, which later cooled and encased the dead god's huge body far below ground. As it began to dream, it wrought unintentional changes in its environment. Locked deep beneath the Earth, strange and unbelievable things faded in and out of reality. Vast caverns and landscapes bubbled to life within the rock, populated by horrible manifestations of the dead god's dream. \n \nOnly during the last few centuries has the god begun to effect changes on the surface of the Earth. Grotesque creatures have been sighted deep in the trackless forest of the Yucatan, and strange rumors of an ancient pyramid- which is neither Aztec nor Mayan- in the same area have been circulating in the archaeological community since the early 1930's. \n \nThe god is awakening.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,29525,25646,27314,26914,11296,26192,28552,37016,44076],"tags":[1,19,268435461,268435487,536870915,536871365,536871939,536872032,536872225,536872286,536876237,536876251,536877216,536885139,1073741825],"developers":[620],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3,453,1027,1120,1313,1374,5325,5339,6304,14227],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":744163200000,"platforms":[14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1365465600000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Apr-09","y":2013,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":744163200000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Aug-01","y":1993,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yvfgsm6xzg8srqoffl6b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yvfgsm6xzg8srqoffl6b","width":480,"height":360}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"5XhUWrxuE1E"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wkcwaoherzrefglmdwgo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wkcwaoherzrefglmdwgo","width":256,"height":331},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/bungie"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathways_into_Darkness"},{"category":2,"url":"http://bungie.wikia.com/wiki/Pathways_into_Darkness"},{"category":1,"url":"https://www.bungie.net/en/AboutUs#page=games\u0026game=10127"}]},{"id":38748,"name":"B.C.E.","slug":"bce","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bce","created_at":1498048507068,"updated_at":1523379687573,"summary":"Before Common Era (B.C.E.) is a top-down multiplayer action game set in the Stone Age.

Welcome to The Labyrinths of Crete, where the blades are sharp and the average life span of a combatant is less than ten minutes. \n \nIn Minotaur, two or more players on different computers are thrown into a huge, randomly generated maze and through the use of various magical and mundane items attempt to find and kill each other. There are over eighty different objects, spells and armaments which any player can pick up and use against his opponents. Loose alliances form and are quickly broken— in the end, only one of the warriors who entered the maze will leave alive! \n \nThe best way to understand Minotaur is to read this documentation carefully and then play the game several times with the quick-reference nearby. You should attempt to learn the effects of all of the objects and spells so that you can use them quickly and to your advantage. \n \nSpeed is critical in Minotaur: recognizing what magic your opponent is using and swiftly moving to counter it is paramount. Keep moving at all times, as he who hesitates is certainly lost. Be ready for your opponents to materialize around you when it is least expected, and hope they are not as watchful.
