It differs from the original FarmVille in a number of ways: \n \nGraphics are more animated and in perspective projection, rather than the isometric projection of the original, and is powered by the Flare3D game engine. \nThe crop-growing cycle is plant–water–wait–harvest — there is no need to plow previously used plots before using them again. In order to water, the player must have adequate water available. Water is automatically credited to the player at intervals up to a maximum capacity, and can also be obtained from wells or received from friends. Trees must also be watered before they will produce fruit. \nHarvested crops and other resources no longer immediately credit the player with coins; rather, they go to the player's inventory. These stored resources can then be sold for coins or used to craft goods. Most crops (but not crafted goods or animal resources) can also be used to make animal feed, which must be given to animals in order that they will produce resources. \nFarmVille 2: Country Escape[edit] \nFarmVille 2: Country Escape for mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone[26] and Windows[27] operating systems) was released on April 10, 2014, and received a positive review from The New York Times.[28] Unlike other games in the FarmVille series, FarmVille 2: Country Escape can be played offline.","collection":4072,"rating":90.0,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":90.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[9765,58630,1942,39755,7434,7046,19934,19290,19301,9655],"tags":[268435469,536871570,536871581,536871682,536871744,536871753,536872010,536872030,536872060,536872594,536872847,536873454,536873753,536873889,536874139,536874542,536874706,536874906,536875046,536875096,536875102,536875159,536875230,536875232,536875233,536875241,536875253,536875356,536875423,536875635,536875712,536875735,536875819,536876274,536876339,536876373,536876417,536876425,536876480,536876516,536876568,536876658,536877321,536877342,536877499,536877563,536877587,536877748,536877816,536877898,536878052,536878294,536878581,536878607,536879217,536879234,536880044,536880057,536880089,536880160,536881627,536881628],"category":0,"keywords":[658,669,770,832,841,1098,1118,1148,1682,1935,2542,2841,2977,3227,3630,3794,3994,4134,4184,4190,4247,4318,4320,4321,4329,4341,4444,4511,4723,4800,4823,4907,5362,5427,5461,5505,5513,5568,5604,5656,5746,6409,6430,6587,6651,6675,6836,6904,6986,7140,7382,7669,7695,8305,8322,9132,9145,9177,9248,10715,10716],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":1397692800000,"platforms":[39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1397692800000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Apr-17","y":2014,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dcqftiin3ay2u9qacqgd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dcqftiin3ay2u9qacqgd","width":552,"height":414},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e1mkngpynqi5nptaiupx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e1mkngpynqi5nptaiupx","width":552,"height":414},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q8l99jq7fzhbeutbyvxn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q8l99jq7fzhbeutbyvxn","width":552,"height":414},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cjd7hy7po4vrhj5qqffn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cjd7hy7po4vrhj5qqffn","width":552,"height":414},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jyjcpbudmfmrpczxgjhv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jyjcpbudmfmrpczxgjhv","width":552,"height":414},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wu85uibzgaaolzl4ojie.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wu85uibzgaaolzl4ojie","width":392,"height":696},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v85tntwx1hmcrp8p0i3y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v85tntwx1hmcrp8p0i3y","width":392,"height":696},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rh141oa138lahqarumsc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rh141oa138lahqarumsc","width":392,"height":696},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ep2a1xzywob5ge2wjfav.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ep2a1xzywob5ge2wjfav","width":392,"height":696},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iwrsjki09uwt9rg5kip6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iwrsjki09uwt9rg5kip6","width":392,"height":696}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/umoc5ghs8pla5wt0tmgk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"umoc5ghs8pla5wt0tmgk","width":650,"height":433},"websites":[{"category":10,"url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/farmville-2-country-escape/id824318267?mt=8\u0026uo=4"}]},{"id":38890,"name":"Castle Clash","slug":"castle-clash","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/castle-clash","created_at":1498058061332,"updated_at":1527625935159,"summary":"Combat strategy at its best!

It’s time to unleash your energi once again and enjoy an immersive experience in a new and exciting world honed to perfection with a massive graphical overhaul, richly developed characters, and a streamlined battle system! \n \nAlphadia II takes players on an unforgettable adventure 200 years after the events of the first Alphadia. Though after seemingly being lost to the inhabitants of the world, energi once again makes its appearance, and before long begins to drive opposing powers into an all out scramble to take control of this ever diminishing resource. \n \n \nEnergi… the source of power interconnected with all living things. \n \nIn times of old, the human race erected a great civilization that thrived on the use of this power. However, some two centuries earlier, an incident known as the Energi Crisis erupted and led to the planet's energi being sealed away. As a result, people lost the mysterious powers they were once capable of harnessing. \n \nThe story now picks up with the protagonist, Leon, who has been assigned to his first solo mission by the Energi Guild. And there within his mind echo the words of the guildmistress when she stated: \"Energi is the hidden power within each individual. It is the power of the heart and mind, and when purposefully sought, its true potential is unleashed.\" \n \nNostalgia at its best! It’s like old-school meets new-school with perfect harmony! \nSporting a colorful and gorgeously detailed 2D battle system, individual break skills, elementals that combine to create more powerful energi skills, and even an auto-battle function, Alphadia II comes equipped with everything fans of traditional JRPGs could expect and caters to both the hardcore and casual gamer alike! \n \nEnergi is the key! \nEnergi is derived from one of six unique elementals and has the power to not only grow, but lead players to the acquisition of new and more powerful energi skills. These energi skills then, in turn, play an integral role in attack, recovery, and even support. Furthermore, once two separate elementals have reached a certain level, they can be combined to create even more powerful energi skills! \n \nCan you handle it?! \nAside from a voluminous story, Alphadia II offers a new \"Mission\" system in which players are able to accept missions from the guild in order to receive valuable coins. These coins can then be exchanged for powerful equipment and other hard-to-get items later on.

Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.[2] \n \nThe game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far.

The game is a sequel to Renegade and was followed by Renegade 3. When acquiring the license to convert the original arcade game Renegade to home computers, Ocean acquired the option to produce and release their own home-computer-only sequels to the game, and Target Renegade was the first of these sequels. \n \nOn most formats, the game caters for one or two players and concerns itself with the adventures of a streetfighter (or a pair of identical streetfighters) known only as \"Renegade\", who seek(s) revenge against a local crime kingpin named \"Mr. Big\" for murdering his or their brother Matt. The player character varies, depending on the format, but is usually represented as topless apart from a leather vest and wearing jeans. \n \nRegardless of the format, the cover of the game and the title screen (as seen on the image to the right) portrays a topless street fighter performing a flying kick through a window. In keeping with video game box art and advertising of the era, the character shown in this illustration bears little relation to any character in the game itself. The actual picture is based on Martial Arts Legend Joe Lewis from the cover of his book The World's Greatest Fighter Teaches You How To Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System, but has been adjusted so as to fit in with the character of Renegade. \n \nThe game comprises five levels, though details of enemies and weapons vary from one version to another (the NES version in particular is more like Double Dragon than the home computer versions).

In this paradise managed by robots there is not any crime, taxes, unemployment, or freedom. The population lives in a domed \"megapolis,\" and perhaps due to the war that occurred during Return to Eden, there is not any contact between the cities and the surrounding natural world. The occasional sighting of flying saucers keeps the population afraid from going outside. \n \nThe main character, a nameless citizen of Enoch, starts the game in a beautiful garden where everything seems fine. He picks an apple from a tree, a worm pops out, and the player follows it outside the garden, through the desert, and then he awakens. It was only a simulation, one of the many forms of entertainment available during the reign of the third Kim. This \"Garden of Eden as a prison\" allegory sets the mood for the entire game. The objective is to explore the city, and while doing so the player must gather clues to unmask the government conspiracy behind the flying saucers. \nDevelopment \n \nThe Worm in Paradise is the third and final instalment of the Silicon Dreams trilogy and is a departure from the previous games. It \"evolved alongside a 12 month enhancement on Level 9's own adventure system. Standard features include a 1,000 word vocabulary, a very highly-advanced English input, memory-enhancing text compression, the now familiar and very much appreciated type-ahead, and multi-tasking so a player need never wait while a picture is drawn.\" This was the first game using version 3 of the A-Code system. It was released for four fewer platforms, excluding the Lynx, Memotech MTX, Nascom and Oric-1 compared to the two previous releases. \n \nAnother difference is that the player has only seven days, within the game's clock, to complete the game. Quests are also time-based and require that the player arrive at certain locations at specific hours to achieve the desired goal. And while game play remains the same, the backdrop is no longer an action adventure, but a political thriller that resembles the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Similar to what happened when Snowball was released, there was certain confusion about the main character's identity and the time when the story is set. The Level 9 Fact Sheet says: \"...a couple of years later, Kim Kimberley has become a legend on Eden.\" Another article stated: \"Worm in Paradise is set 100 years later. You are now Kim Kimberley III...\" Furthermore, Pete Austin said, \"Worm is set on Eden, about 50 years in the future\" and \"The player is not Kim - she becomes mayor and runs the place.\" Notice that these sources termed the game by its original name, Worm in Paradise.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":39156,"name":"Silicon Dreams - Return to Eden","slug":"silicon-dreams-return-to-eden","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/silicon-dreams-return-to-eden","created_at":1498121386972,"updated_at":1500211224774,"summary":"Plot \n \nWith the Snowball 9 orbiting Eden, the surviving crew members put Kim on trial. The only evidence against her is the \"mempak\" from the control room, which shows her as the hijacker rather than the saviour. Despite the fact that the recording is damaged and thus is unreliable, they sentence her to death. About to be thrown into space, Kim manages to escape aboard a \"stratoglider\" and an hour later, lands on Eden. At this point the game starts. \n \nThe first thing the player must do is find a shelter for Kim, because a few moves into the game the Snowball 9 crew use the ship's engine to try to burn her down. The native robots take this as proof that the Snowball 9 is not the ship they were expecting but a hostile alien craft they must destroy. The objective is to contact the robots before time ends for the Snowball 9 and everyone aboard it. \n \nDevelopment \n \nUnlike its predecessor, Return to Eden only had about two hundred and fifty locations, but it was Level 9's first game to feature graphics.[5] Other adventure games had included graphics before, but version 2 of the A-Code system, allowed Level 9 to encode location graphics into as little as forty bytes. This size made it possible to add graphics to every location of the game for all formats with more than 32 K RAM. The user could choose not to display them and play the game in text-only mode. It was released for the same platforms as its predecessor. \n \nThe game's first cover depicted a robot fighting a monster plant in Enoch. The robot resembled a comic book character, so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson's illustration depicted another robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was not satisfied with the result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover so much, they hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release of their old games as well as for their future titles. \n \nPete Austin commented on the game: \"It's an alien theme park gone wild. The Eden universe is more like Larry Niven's future space.\" and \"...is intended as a comment on superpower intervention in the Third World.\"","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":39157,"name":"Silicon Dreams - Snowball","slug":"silicon-dreams-snowball","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/silicon-dreams-snowball","created_at":1498121388804,"updated_at":1500211212140,"summary":"Plot \n \nAs the Snowball 9 approaches Eden, something goes wrong. A crew member murders her shipmates, destroys the communication system and sets the ship on a collision course with the sun. The robots, being little more than automata, continue their everyday operations oblivious to the danger but the ship's computer, capable of thinking, awakens Kim Kimberley before the deranged crew member destroys it. She exits her modified stasis chamber with the goal of finding a way to reach the control room and avert disaster. \nDevelopment \n \nSnowball was originally released during 1983 as the company's fourth adventure game using the A-Code system.[1] Nick, Mike, and Pete Austin headed development. Though Level 9's previous games featured a fantasy theme, the Austin brothers chose a science fiction theme.[5] The original release used version 1 of this system[6] and was initially released only for the BBC Micro, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Nascom,[7] but was later followed by versions for the Commodore 64, Camputers Lynx, Oric-1, Atari 8-bit[8] as well as for the Memotech MTX, Amstrad CPC, Enterprise and MSX.[9] It is noteworthy for including over seven thousand locations. To achieve this sixty-eight hundred locations on the passenger disks form a colour-coded maze with minimal descriptions. \n \nAnother peculiar aspect of the game was the confusion behind the main character's gender. In an interview for Sinclair User, Chris Bourne asked, \"Is the androgynous Kim a man or woman?\" Pete Austin pointed out that \"there's a credit at the end for the design of 'Ms Kimberley's costume,' \" but also admitted that Kim Kimberley was \"a deliberately unisex name.\" The debate came to an end with the release of Return to Eden, where it was made more explicit that Kim was not a man, because the surviving crew members confuse her with the woman who tried to destroy the ship.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":39158,"name":"Jewels of Darkness - Dungeon Adventure","slug":"jewels-of-darkness-dungeon-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jewels-of-darkness-dungeon-adventure","created_at":1498121392369,"updated_at":1500211200479,"summary":"The final game in the Jewels of Darkness trilogy","popularity":1.666666666666667,"category":0},{"id":39159,"name":"Jewels of Darkness - Colossal Adventure","slug":"jewels-of-darkness-colossal-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jewels-of-darkness-colossal-adventure","created_at":1498121410000,"updated_at":1500211188829,"summary":"The first adventure in the Jewels of Darness trilogy","popularity":1.666666666666667,"category":0},{"id":39160,"name":"Jewels of Darkness - Adventure Quest","slug":"jewels-of-darkness-adventure-quest","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jewels-of-darkness-adventure-quest","created_at":1498121412201,"updated_at":1500211176502,"summary":"The second game in the Jewels of Darkness trilogy","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":39161,"name":"Chicago's 30","slug":"chicagos-30","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chicagos-30","created_at":1498121414400,"updated_at":1508706099578,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,1070,28029,76246,19341,1073,76229,32902,68287,68142],"tags":[1,268435461,268435464,536872472,1073741828],"developers":[13038],"publishers":[227,13038],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1560],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[63,15,26,25,27],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kyg9exzt3xyyqc8ctl0g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kyg9exzt3xyyqc8ctl0g","width":1000,"height":1289}},{"id":39162,"name":"Herores Rescue","slug":"herores-rescue","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/herores-rescue","created_at":1498121416720,"updated_at":1500210885862,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":39163,"name":"Panic Dizzy","slug":"panic-dizzy","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/panic-dizzy","created_at":1498121418796,"updated_at":1500210964950,"summary":"\"Dizzy hits the panic stations as the hydraulic crushers get closer and closer, belching steam - the machines going into termination sequence and its down to you to stop it.\" \n \nDizzy Panic! was a puzzle game similar to Tetris, which involved moving a wall left to right so that falling shapes can pass through the appropriately shapes holes in the wall.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":39164,"name":"Reckless Rufus","slug":"reckless-rufus","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/reckless-rufus","created_at":1498121422546,"updated_at":1516747977297,"summary":"A puzzle game from the early nineties.

Two of these creatures, humans and demons, have been struggling against each other for many years. As the centuries passed, control shifted from demons to humans and back again. The humans finally earned a clear victory after the First Neverland War. But this left the country in ruins and led directly to the Second Neverland War, which saw the decisive victory of the demons once again. \nMagic Age 1053— \nTragedy strikes the small woodland village of Petun—the town is attacked and burned to the ground by vicious Neverland troops. But Petun is only the first of many massacres; the Demon Army tears through every human village it can find, slaughtering the people as it goes.

There is also the chance, for any class except the wizard, that the spell will fail and you will transform into a pig for a short time.","popularity":1.0,"games":[10039,36926,25300,12632,36950,19333,16999,27209,54842,22418],"tags":[1,268435460,536871138,536871213,536871470,536871506,536871938,536872978,536875198,536875331,536875699,536877565],"category":0,"keywords":[226,301,558,594,1026,2066,4286,4419,4787,6653],"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lrzl18d3romyysduyyth.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lrzl18d3romyysduyyth","width":902,"height":1280}},{"id":39289,"name":"Knights of Valour Super Heroes","slug":"knights-of-valour-super-heroes","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/knights-of-valour-super-heroes","created_at":1498123682736,"updated_at":1500218685982,"popularity":1.0,"games":[2907,10039,36794,36608,74155,34919,19658,1235,40524,75089],"tags":[1,268435460],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":917827200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":917827200000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Feb-01","y":1999,"m":2}]},{"id":39290,"name":"Hyper Crash","slug":"hyper-crash","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hyper-crash","created_at":1498123685042,"updated_at":1515823261236,"summary":"Player driving a black night rider like car to race against many red cars and ultimately can crash them into oil barrels or walls.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,3772,665,28379,36662,51485,74601,19539,24918,4019],"tags":[1,268435466,268435489,536870937,536871501,536871969,536872695,536874337,536874539,536875069,536875075,536875117,536876727,1073741826],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[25,589,1057,1783,3425,3627,4157,4163,4205,5815],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,33],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":539136000000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zd6h41ldflx5j16w966n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zd6h41ldflx5j16w966n","width":1152,"height":720}},{"id":39291,"name":"Daytona USA 2","slug":"daytona-usa-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/daytona-usa-2","created_at":1498123688321,"updated_at":1515725079810,"summary":"Daytona USA 2: Battle on the Edge is an arcade racing game released by Sega in 1998 as a follow-up to the extremely successful Daytona USA. The game featured vastly superior graphics, utilizing the Sega Model 3 hardware. The majority of Daytona USA 2 cabinets were released as deluxe models (with far fewer Twin Cabinets), which could be linked together for up to four players. A notable change from the original is the ability to select a car and corresponding driver, each with varying capabilities for varying levels of player experience. Just like before, the game has three courses – a Beginner course with 8 laps, an Advanced course with 4 laps, and a long Expert course with 2 laps. The 'time lap' mode also returns, and is accessed in the same manner – by holding down start at the transmission select screen. Like the original game, mirrored versions of the tracks can also be played by holding down the Start button when selecting the course. It is recommended, however, that the player has had mastery of the course beforehand. By request, an arcade operator could put the game on Grand Prix or Endurance mode to increase the number of laps in a game. Finishing a race in the top 3 in any course allows the player to view an \"ending\" and see the game credits.","collection":3364,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[40470,28856,72770,45500,54789,73482,36662,19419,54790,49274],"tags":[268435466,536872590,536872695,536874907,536875069,536875128,536875870,536875955,536876816,536876818,536879182,536879963,536882168,536882291],"category":0,"keywords":[1678,1783,3995,4157,4216,4958,5043,5904,5906,8270,9051,11256,11379],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":899251200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":899251200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Jul-01","y":1998,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/govy28dv26dazgux1cz9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"govy28dv26dazgux1cz9","width":850,"height":1098}},{"id":39292,"name":"All American Football","slug":"all-american-football","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/all-american-football","created_at":1498123692379,"updated_at":1515861519074,"summary":"An American football game up to four players with all the features of \"John Elway's Team Quarterback\" and much more : improved graphics, sideline shop, etc...","popularity":1.0,"games":[18681,15041,57738,701,15851,54662,14713,100359,77778,77041],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536870939],"category":0,"keywords":[26,27],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":628473600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":628473600000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Dec-01","y":1989,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aimzh0bb87uq21udyrxi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aimzh0bb87uq21udyrxi","width":850,"height":1192}},{"id":39293,"name":"Frog \u0026 Spiders","slug":"frog-and-spiders","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/frog-and-spiders","created_at":1498123693508,"updated_at":1516586511235,"summary":"An arcade shooter from Taito in 1981.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,68279,36781,36718,27523,28029,7291,142,10039,76246],"tags":[268435461,536871581,536871937,536872668,536873486,536875147,536875151,536875666],"category":0,"keywords":[669,1025,1756,2574,4235,4239,4754],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":378604800000,"region":2,"human":"1981-Dec-31","y":1981,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kkskadf197jv8a0ikrrn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kkskadf197jv8a0ikrrn","width":850,"height":1197}},{"id":39294,"name":"Balloon Bomber","slug":"balloon-bomber","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/balloon-bomber","created_at":1498123697588,"updated_at":1515861537658,"summary":"You control a shooter that moves left and right and shoots balloons that drop bombs at you.

The world quickly formed a group of pilots and planes called the Strikers whose mission is to rid of CANY from the world.","collection":2850,"rating":79.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":71.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":75.0,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":0,"games":[81141,27316,17446,83728,9243,26422,103020,19319,9182,27091],"tags":[1,17,22,268435461,268435469,268435489,536870931,536871078,536871470,536872873,536875067,536875137,536875281,536875419,536875562,536875879,536876114,536876211,536876634,536876642,536880464,536885902,536888299,536889479,536893268,536893269,536893270,1073741827],"developers":[2888],"publishers":[4228,818,2888],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[19,166,558,1961,4155,4225,4369,4507,4650,4967,5202,5299,5722,5730,9552,14990,17387,18567,22356,22357,22358],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[5,13,33],"first_release_date":812764800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[52,32,7,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":837734400000,"human":"1996-Jul-19","y":1996,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":835920000000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Jun-28","y":1996,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1501718400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Aug-03","y":2017,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":812764800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Oct-04","y":1995,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nr8hk2dfaytq7dsxpp4c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nr8hk2dfaytq7dsxpp4c","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xz5cklfmztrcglrmh85d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xz5cklfmztrcglrmh85d","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qn5yqpcqbq3wqzisgppv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qn5yqpcqbq3wqzisgppv","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dhdjxeh735qggaiisgk8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dhdjxeh735qggaiisgk8","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eu3ghf52yhhh6vynzz4e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eu3ghf52yhhh6vynzz4e","width":745,"height":419}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mdivzcvkc77c190x1bj1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mdivzcvkc77c190x1bj1","width":1280,"height":906},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikers_1945"}]},{"id":39301,"name":"Sky Fox","slug":"sky-fox","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sky-fox","created_at":1498123726044,"updated_at":1500219162190,"summary":"The game is a vertical shoot 'em up in the style of Galaga and Phoenix,but with eight-way movement across the screen and parallax scrolling for the stars backgrounds.

Spells can be used by means of magical rings or by the two playable spellcasters (a cleric and an elf).","collection":3395,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10253,21567,2933,76,2368,1593,19560,3231,27092,6],"tags":[1,268435468,268435481,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871504,536871894,536871938,536871945,536871971,536872225,536872257,536872978,536873064,536873066,536873718,536874134,536874209,536874398,536874745,536874830,536875196,536875306,536875311,536875319,536875331,536875372,536875464,536875491,536875537,536875610,536875655,536875699,536875767,536875778,536875830,536875870,536875903,536875944,536876010,536876301,536876607,536876615,536876730,536876879,536876989,536877422,536877562,536878112,536878192,536878346,536878347,536878348,536878351,536878353,536878355,536878358,536878359,536878360,536884377],"category":0,"keywords":[226,227,296,301,332,592,982,1026,1033,1059,1313,1345,2066,2152,2154,2806,3222,3297,3486,3833,3918,4284,4394,4399,4407,4419,4460,4552,4579,4625,4698,4743,4787,4855,4866,4918,4958,4991,5032,5098,5389,5695,5703,5818,5967,6077,6510,6650,7200,7280,7434,7435,7436,7439,7441,7443,7446,7447,7448,13465],"themes":[1],"genres":[12,25],"first_release_date":786412800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":786412800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Dec-03","y":1994,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Dungeons and Dragons: Tower of Doom","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fwufim9sf7zcp2w7wa3u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fwufim9sf7zcp2w7wa3u","width":850,"height":1210}},{"id":39329,"name":"'88 Games","slug":"88-games","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/88-games","created_at":1498124000345,"updated_at":1516724282716,"summary":"Konami '88 (also known as '88 Games or Hyper Sports Special) is the third in the Track \u0026 Field game series by Konami, where you test your Olympic skills against other world-class athletes.

Bubbles can be picked up and dropped by the player's \"clown\" at the bottom, and are destroyed when three or more of the same color are put together on a single column. \"Chains\" are formed either when a single drop caused a chain reaction, or when more than one group of bubbles is destroyed in quick succession. The game is normally played with two players (one may be a computer opponent), and chains cause the opponent's stack to descend faster. \n \nThere are 24 characters, all but the Black Pierrot being named after a tarot card (although the Strength card has been represented by two characters throughout the series). Different characters have different attack patterns. The columns of the opponent's stack will descend at different rates relative to each other depending on the character chosen. This causes a disjunction of colors that may make it more difficult for the other player to clear their stack. For example, with the character Devil, all the columns will descend at the same rate, whereas with Sun, the middle columns will descend faster than the others.","rating":70.0,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":70.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"publishers":[2837],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":791596800000,"platforms":[80,52,136,79,5,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1498694400000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Jun-29","y":2017,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1498694400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Jun-29","y":2017,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1274745600000,"region":5,"human":"2010-May-25","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1291334400000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Dec-03","y":2010,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1290988800000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Nov-29","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":822182400000,"region":2,"human":"1996-Jan-21","y":1996,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":832896000000,"region":5,"human":"1996-May-24","y":1996,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":822182400000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Jan-21","y":1996,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":822009600000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Jan-19","y":1996,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":791596800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Feb-01","y":1995,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rcekhstnhjshnx1lm8nq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rcekhstnhjshnx1lm8nq","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oh6yeu8cuv5k81l78tze.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oh6yeu8cuv5k81l78tze","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scjefnitk8eabuauhtq4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"scjefnitk8eabuauhtq4","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ajhzfgoacuiourmr3fb8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ajhzfgoacuiourmr3fb8","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hz7gsqobknsyhgshxgnp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hz7gsqobknsyhgshxgnp","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/thqklql9qi1c42tk6mxw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"thqklql9qi1c42tk6mxw","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n8yi1tkojogf4jncn8cl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n8yi1tkojogf4jncn8cl","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/idjnm9cex3bpyrfccfx6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"idjnm9cex3bpyrfccfx6","width":304,"height":224}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t8svfnk7j03gkrjm4te3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t8svfnk7j03gkrjm4te3","width":850,"height":1211}},{"id":39349,"name":"Golden Axe: The Duel","slug":"golden-axe-the-duel","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/golden-axe-the-duel","created_at":1498124309526,"updated_at":1515610455811,"summary":"Many years have passed since the last war with Death Adder.

The levels take place in various interactive locations, involving inside a plane, a moving train, an office building or even at the circus.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":39382,"name":"Mouser","slug":"mouser","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mouser","created_at":1498126910928,"updated_at":1515581115843,"popularity":1.0,"games":[34919,36608,16468,23175,59516,28029,55289,10039,40524,25646],"tags":[1,536871599,536875241,536875280,536875283,536875362,536875530,536876373],"category":0,"keywords":[687,4329,4368,4371,4450,4618,5461],"themes":[1],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fdc67rthsoxxv75wbpoo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fdc67rthsoxxv75wbpoo","width":826,"height":1080}},{"id":39383,"name":"Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa","slug":"wild-west-c-dot-o-w-dot-boys-of-moo-mesa","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wild-west-c-dot-o-w-dot-boys-of-moo-mesa","created_at":1498126913283,"updated_at":1515750362808,"summary":"In the 1800's, a mysterious comet hits the U.S. southwest, transforming the local cattle and animals into their own version of the old west called Moo Mesa, complete with several lawmen dealing with bizarre outlaws.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[2907,10039,36794,36608,74155,34919,19658,1235,40524,75089],"tags":[1,268435460],"category":0,"keywords":[9,166,1059,1128,3540,4142,4162,4379,4380,6366],"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":724723200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":724723200000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Dec-19","y":1992,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a4qdjfquhdqggczsb0bb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a4qdjfquhdqggczsb0bb","width":840,"height":1152},"esrb":{"rating":1}},{"id":39384,"name":"Major Havoc","slug":"major-havoc","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/major-havoc","created_at":1498126915945,"updated_at":1515728101371,"summary":"Long ago the evil Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy.

Five of these elders—Ballossum Pench, Gabriel Hammer, Jimchuck Spanner, Olsorro Slasher, and Leonard Drill—obtained immortality, and became known as the Motoruin sages. Eventually, they attempted to take over the Parts kingdom and start a new world order, collapsing the government and destroying parts of the country in the process. As their plans unfold, five children of one of these villages decide to battle the Motoruin using another new invention: the semi-automatic propelling engine, known as \"Progear\". \n \nAt the start of the game, the player is given a choice between two pilots/planes and three gunners, which determines the effectiveness of their respective modes.

Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble, including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta. \n \nSome versions of the game, including the PlayStation, feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other. \n \nCompletion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock 'Another World' for the single player game, which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble.

The four boss characters from the first edition became selectable characters and a feature was added that allowed two players to select the same character, with one character being distinguished from the other with an alternate color scheme. Characters using their alternate color scheme have their names printed in blue below their lifebar. The number of opponents in the single-player mode increased to twelve due to the addition of clone matches. Some of the artwork was redrawn as well and the stages' backgrounds were recolored. Much of the gameplay was revised to balance the characters out. From this edition onward, the maximum number of rounds was reduced to four. \n \nChampion Edition (as well as The World Warrior) is known for being the target of a number of illegally sold hacks due to its popularity.

In these events, the player(s) may be running and turning a corner and they face an enemy, so they must perform a designated command to avoid being injured or to help defeat an enemy.

It features 73 teams countries. Each team enters a \"Regional Qualifying Round Final\" where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player wins the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For Example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of Super Sidekicks 3. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, Kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (Teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). It's slogan is \"We got the kick\". \n \nUnlike its arcade counter-part, the Neo Geo version tries to be more of a soccer simulation game. Differences include the Neo Geo version more slowed down, and more realism added in shooting, passing, etc.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[54662,48305,42363,15851,27081,10121,18681,24634,81432,70102],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536872078,536875433,536876259],"publishers":[1474],"category":0,"keywords":[26,1166,4521,5347],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":883612800000,"platforms":[80,52,119,79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":885945600000,"region":2,"human":"1998-Jan-28","y":1998,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":119,"date":883612800000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Jan-01","y":1998,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":885945600000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Jan-28","y":1998,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":886118400000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Jan-30","y":1998,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":891561600000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Apr-03","y":1998,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pkh74tnzdugllvw9op67.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pkh74tnzdugllvw9op67","width":850,"height":1207}},{"id":39530,"name":"Kizuna Encounter: Super Tag Battle","slug":"kizuna-encounter-super-tag-battle","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kizuna-encounter-super-tag-battle","created_at":1498129858650,"updated_at":1516164915407,"summary":"One year ago, King Leo had made the Battle of the Beast God tournament in order to see on who had what it took to challenge and fight against him from within their own given time and opportunity.

At that time, two worlds, one near and one far, were born. Thus the history of life and death began. \n \nHalf a year has passed since Suzaku's madness, and the underworld is still linked by a great portal. Kagami's great sin is still heard as if ringing from the heavens. Our world has been called upon. Legends of long ago told of the sealing of the boundary between the two worlds. The Sealing Rite would be necessary to hold back the spirits of that far away world. \n \nHowever, the Sealing Rite brings together the power of the Four Gods and Sealing Maiden, for the first time properly completing the ritual. \n \nTo find the Sealing Maiden, Genbu began searching in the center of the world, from which all things begin. At the same time in the underworld, in the depths of darkness, many spirits conspired, plotting to hinder the Sealing Rite. They had but one wish, to be reborn into our world.","collection":4294,"popularity":1.0,"games":[17548,19333,76885,28175,61985,37032,41828,17714,32172,59427],"tags":[268435460,536870973,536871019,536871139,536871165,536871208,536871969,536873370,536875778,536876636,536880447,1073741828],"developers":[1474],"publishers":[1474],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[61,107,227,253,296,1057,2458,4866,5724,9535],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":911952000000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[80,45,136,79,49,5,130,23],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1529539200000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jun-21","y":2018,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1518652800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Feb-15","y":2018,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1464048000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-May-24","y":2016,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1354752000000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Dec-06","y":2012,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1349913600000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Oct-11","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1345507200000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Aug-21","y":2012,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":997056000000,"region":2,"human":"2001-Aug-06","y":2001,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":977356800000,"region":5,"human":"2000-Dec-21","y":2000,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":920073600000,"human":"1999-Feb-27","y":1999,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":917481600000,"human":"1999-Jan-28","y":1999,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":911952000000,"human":"1998-Nov-25","y":1998,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"幕末浪漫第二幕 月華の剣士 ～月に咲く華、散りゆく花～","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kkdkejpfws0ijupxsceb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kkdkejpfws0ijupxsceb","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hur1aod3gtvni3ojra7e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hur1aod3gtvni3ojra7e","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yzqlfkyiocuhlol0wz9f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yzqlfkyiocuhlol0wz9f","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/chgnho6giitfmunriqhk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"chgnho6giitfmunriqhk","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p9am5dtxz5j1hpzm7f6f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p9am5dtxz5j1hpzm7f6f","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gf93utdsr8crbsnfjrag.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gf93utdsr8crbsnfjrag","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yqk9ngo5ialzz7wyur1l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yqk9ngo5ialzz7wyur1l","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jdf4ezq2iuha8kwiswky.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jdf4ezq2iuha8kwiswky","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pz4a6fghzojabtcwccup.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pz4a6fghzojabtcwccup","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zahwahdudx49mv2crvya.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zahwahdudx49mv2crvya","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/na8rekp7rurninwy543s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"na8rekp7rurninwy543s","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k3hir1nkkbpoz6cpcd8w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k3hir1nkkbpoz6cpcd8w","width":304,"height":224}],"artworks":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yuq9rkqwmr9qd7jiwqmv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yuq9rkqwmr9qd7jiwqmv","width":680,"height":900},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mf5bkwlvemdgu5pcnult.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mf5bkwlvemdgu5pcnult","width":620,"height":900},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/upivn0y4mef2ky9uiuuo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"upivn0y4mef2ky9uiuuo","width":700,"height":900},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zasonslbbhnlxl8bcjoc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zasonslbbhnlxl8bcjoc","width":520,"height":1000},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dvwyd6gsdmzhsrwbpgr7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvwyd6gsdmzhsrwbpgr7","width":900,"height":620},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wrudxaj6cluc5dqbbozo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wrudxaj6cluc5dqbbozo","width":970,"height":570},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i53ustp5ursdry9omflq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i53ustp5ursdry9omflq","width":900,"height":600}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"-DQsa_nM9e4"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ykochf5jrnwpvxqxcmyx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ykochf5jrnwpvxqxcmyx","width":843,"height":1200},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Blade_2"},{"category":2,"url":"http://snk.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Blade_2"}]},{"id":39539,"name":"Last Blade","slug":"last-blade","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/last-blade","created_at":1498129967772,"updated_at":1534760167830,"summary":"1863.

It's all yours: A new type of weapon fighting game in which Power and Speed weapons, in addition to various Repel moves can be used to experience a new sensation in video game thrills!","storyline":"A translation of the story officially given by SNK is as follows: \n \n\"Two worlds once existed since ancient times... The world of the living, Ushyo, and the land of the dead, Tokoyo. A legendary boundary to forever separate them, The Hell's Gate, has existed since the birth of myths to keep an universal balance. There is said to be four gods that defend it: Seiryu of the East, Byakko of the West, Genbu of the North, and Suzaku of the South. They eternally perform their duty from the shadows of legend and were eventually forgotten by people as time passed. \n \nNow, it is the 'Bakumatsu'. \n \nThe Tokugawa shogunate, after 200 years of reign, began to have samurai who long dulled their battle skills during the outskirts of the Heian period. People, who have long since grown used to peace, are met with fascinating foreigners and wonder about the confines of their isolation. To add to the confusion, a sudden disturbance occurs. \n \nA natural disaster unprecedented in Japan's history began. It was rumored to be the Majin Revival, a time when gods were to walk the land once more and deliver divine punishment. In a land where no chaos was said to exist, the people could do nothing but watch and despair. \n \nHowever, it was said that there are individuals who did not. People who haven't lost their fighting spirit and stood to face the chaos. Those who wanted to find the real cause behind the disturbance and stop it. Moreover, people who were unexpectedly born at the center of chaos. Those who had the ambitions to control the threat and those who are said to be the cause of the Majin Revival. Without speculation of their cause, they are brought together by a heavy fate as their battle begins.\" \n \nThe passage to the land of the dead, Hell's Gate, which was previously guarded by Four Sacred Beasts appears to be opened. However, chaos sweeps the land once the gods are encased in human flesh, otherwise known as the Majin Revival. The story of the series continues to focus on how certain individuals choose to confront such conflict, and depicts how each of them are drawn on the same string of fate.","collection":4294,"rating":85.0,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":85.0,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":1,"games":[105056,78625,2254,103269,106859,106777,103848,99742,99740,99735],"tags":[268435460,1073741828],"developers":[1474],"publishers":[1474],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":883958400000,"platforms":[52,5,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1513209600000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Dec-14","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1513209600000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Dec-14","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1331596800000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Mar-13","y":2012,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1343865600000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Aug-02","y":2012,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1339027200000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Jun-07","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":883958400000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Jan-05","y":1998,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"幕末浪漫 月華の剣士","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oj4arqpuvzx4fkxosbup.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oj4arqpuvzx4fkxosbup","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l0hblm6vnlkivoeab0pe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l0hblm6vnlkivoeab0pe","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jvqabgxvejihekvhdt3n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jvqabgxvejihekvhdt3n","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bns3pxfbk1olbce88bb1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bns3pxfbk1olbce88bb1","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qaxpzqirfzqkxgkfcj8o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qaxpzqirfzqkxgkfcj8o","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dounotiwe8qkquosewyj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dounotiwe8qkquosewyj","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qhny9rh1zzkncqfbv8zw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qhny9rh1zzkncqfbv8zw","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lgw3t6fj41kbbx7a6biw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lgw3t6fj41kbbx7a6biw","width":559,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rc3helgp9dzpparntwjy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rc3helgp9dzpparntwjy","width":559,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xhqrduhhndacyakp15cw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xhqrduhhndacyakp15cw","width":559,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z65spemo0qskkjm22p1u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z65spemo0qskkjm22p1u","width":559,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nmt6imrxjpovqurgtuh6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nmt6imrxjpovqurgtuh6","width":559,"height":419}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"pYoVkj-WCrg"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rzhazklf2vbh5mgk0pja.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rzhazklf2vbh5mgk0pja","width":650,"height":905},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Blade"},{"category":2,"url":"http://snk.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Blade"}]},{"id":39540,"name":"Neo Mr. Do!","slug":"neo-mr-do","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/neo-mr-do","created_at":1498129970443,"updated_at":1513073766098,"summary":"Mr. Do!

The \ndestructive nuclear horrors unleashed upon the planet and its population \ncreated uncountable amounts of death and devastation. In the wake of this \nsweeping havoc arose the planet itself to retaliate against the violence \nforced upon it. Polar shifts and massive earthquakes swallowed entire \ncontinents. From seething seas and walls of water arose angry volcanoes, \nspewing flame and death into the sky. Hungry fires, searing blizzards, and \nbrutal storms ran rampant across the planet's surface for years, in an attempt \nto wash away the man-made horrors that it was forced to endure. \n \nAt last the earth settled into a new pattern, starting to find some \nsemblance of balance and peace. The global changes had left a much harsher \nplanet, and the remaining life forms adapted slowly to the new environment. \nThe Earth's land masses, altered by man-made weaponry and ended through \nelemental means, had evolved into ten isolated provinces. The remaining \npopulations within these new provinces found life difficult at first, but \nslowly evolution and natural selection allowed the human race to adapt and \nonce again gain control of their destiny. Some of the provinces had strong \nnatural forces, exposed through the abrupt upheaval, and the resourceful \npost-humans began to master these new powers. Other provinces continued to \ndevelop through the use of science and technology, creating elaborate life \nsupport systems and protection against the harsh environments. \n \nAs the years progressed, eight of the provinces began to communicate and \ntrade together. An alliance was formed and a global quasi-government was \nestablished. The social structure evolved into a mixture of medieval \npractices, hybrid technology, and barbarism and barter. \n \nCenturies have passed and the present day Earth finds mankind again at the \nbrink of savagery and destruction. Life is now a series of hardships, \ndeceptions, and lies for the members of the Provincial Alliance. The frozen \ntundra of Polaria and the volcanic Scorch are very close to all out war, \nhalted only by the desolate, radioactive Death Zone that separates them. The \nDeath Zone, once a founding member of the Planet Alliance, has remained silent \nfor almost two centuries, hiding behind the mysterious and deadly red mists \nthat define its borders. Obsel, the desert province, has been taken over by \ndesperate and brutal female terrorists. The Ebony Coast, known for its trade \nand bartering systems, is now led by a mysterious and greedy leader whom no \none trusts, yet all must tolerate. The people of Cyberia, a land inhabitable \nonly through technological means, have re-engineered their population, and are \nlosing their humanity to the machine. \n \nWith tensions running high, the Planet Alliance is beginning to falter and \nthe provinces are no longer considered allies. And now the High Emperor, the \none guiding force that all provinces had agreed to abide by, has been \nmysteriously and horribly murdered. \n \nThe ancient Provincial Agreement declares that a new ruler must be chosen \nthrough combat between the rulers of each province. Each province will come \nprepared for battle with their own Gauntlet of Ascension, a gloved weapon that \nonly those in power may don. These ancient gauntlets are treasured and \nrevered by their people, for they are the foremost symbol of power and honor \neach province can have. \n \nBut it is painfully clear that this tournament will not have the honor of \nprevious BloodStorm contests. There have even been rumors that the combatants \nwill bring back the Sunder Attack, a brutal combat move that separated the \nopponent's legs from his body without killing him. This horrible and \nhumiliating maneuver has never been officially banned from the BloodStorm \ncontest, yet it is so brutal and degrading that no honorable combatant has \nused it for centuries. However, these champions from radically different \nprovinces are blind to the mysterious evil that surrounds the High Emperor's \ndeath, and instead only see their opportunity for personal gain, provincial \nexpansion, or race domination and will do anything to achieve their goals. \n \n \nThe BloodStorm is about to begin!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75962,46815,75964,75858,75857,75853,68609,55058,50726,50704],"tags":[268435460],"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":775699200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":775699200000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Aug-01","y":1994,"m":8}]},{"id":39561,"name":"Battle K-Road","slug":"battle-k-road","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-k-road","created_at":1498132412954,"updated_at":1515836519225,"summary":"The game focuses mostly on reality fighting than fictional.

If the clock hits zero, the player loses and the game is over unless they can continue. While driving, the time is hindered by barrels, puddles, slippery ice, cones and other obstacles in the player's path. Even other cars driving can be an obstacle. Also the player has to keep straight when driving up slopes, or the car will swerve and crash. The player can gain more time if they make it through checkpoints in between the starting and finishing points. The player can also take shortcuts. Before making a turn, the player will always get an immediate warning on the screen with a voice saying which direction the player ought to turn and certain warnings. \n \nAside from the starting Practice stage, there are six other stages to be conquered: European, African, Snow Land, Southern Hemisphere, Scandinavian, and Great Britain.","collection":3429,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55192,40470,23314,28856,18699,83217,82502,80729,80382,80309],"tags":[268435466,536875069],"publishers":[13784],"category":0,"keywords":[4157],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":822787200000,"platforms":[52,136,79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":822787200000,"region":2,"human":"1996-Jan-28","y":1996,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":838339200000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Jul-26","y":1996,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":822787200000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Jan-28","y":1996,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":841017600000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Aug-26","y":1996,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gicaeninki0hts8g1et5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gicaeninki0hts8g1et5","width":850,"height":1200}},{"id":39601,"name":"Melty Blood: Act Cadenza Ver.

A bootleg of this game is known as West Story. \n \nIn 'Blood Bros., two blood brothers, a cowboy and an Indian, team-up to hunt down \"the most wanted outlaw in Dodge City,\" Big Bad John. The gameplay mechanics are extremely similar to TAD Corp.'s earlier machine, Cabal, however this game did not seem to appear as a trackball-controlled variant. \n \nThe player's characters are seen from behind. Some screens feature protective walls (which can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The players have limitless ammunition for their primary gun, but a limited number of sticks of dynamite, with which they must fend off enemy troops. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structural features of the screen (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage, reprising the amusing \"victory dance walk\" into the horizon from Cabal. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. \n \nPower-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen or special characters who may run across, such as the small Indian Chief figure or warthogs.

You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.","rating":67.0,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":67.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"publishers":[2837],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":663811200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[80,52,136,79,5,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1504742400000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Sep-07","y":2017,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1504742400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Sep-07","y":2017,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1193097600000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Oct-23","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1194566400000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Nov-09","y":2007,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1194825600000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Nov-12","y":2007,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":783561600000,"region":2,"human":"1994-Oct-31","y":1994,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":663811200000,"region":2,"human":"1991-Jan-14","y":1991,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":678326400000,"region":2,"human":"1991-Jul-01","y":1991,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":678758400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Jul-06","y":1991,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iy33v8zedefwbqqwkrpy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iy33v8zedefwbqqwkrpy","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bejewe4esg6kcvbsfksg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bejewe4esg6kcvbsfksg","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fet3h3ept2mthbx6o7og.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fet3h3ept2mthbx6o7og","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ou92erzzi1jeieofvtut.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ou92erzzi1jeieofvtut","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m5jwj1cugorwqw3pseoj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m5jwj1cugorwqw3pseoj","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rclbkaslo3hb0plx38kl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rclbkaslo3hb0plx38kl","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b01p4k0vaocg6daoghwq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b01p4k0vaocg6daoghwq","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fgsdgiahios0muulgewn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fgsdgiahios0muulgewn","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wwgk51slklvbdb0h8k2g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wwgk51slklvbdb0h8k2g","width":320,"height":224}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lsjo5jp8fxm1plam0wgf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lsjo5jp8fxm1plam0wgf","width":600,"height":761},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%27s_Journey"}]},{"id":39654,"name":"Block Out","slug":"block-out","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/block-out","created_at":1498134757898,"updated_at":1515722458781,"summary":"Block Out is a Tetris variant with an added twist: it's in 3D.

The player takes control of a young soldier equipped with magical wings who must save the world from a malfunctioning supercomputer. \n Legendary Wings is set in a distant future where an alien supercomputer named \"Dark\", which has been helping human civilization achieve a new state of enlightenment since ancient times, has suddenly rebelled against mankind. Two young warriors are given the Wings of Love and Courage by the God of War Ares in order to destroy Dark and ensure mankind's survival. \n The coin-op version of Legendary Wings can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with a second player being allowed to join the game at any time or even continue after a game over. The game's controls consists of an eight-way joystick and two buttons which changes depending on the context. The game consists of five areas with two different playing styles: the first segment in each stage is a top-view vertical scrolling segment in which the player flies across the sky, shooting at airborne enemies with their gun while dropping bombs at ground enemies, in order to reach the palace at the end of segment. When the player defeats the guardian and gains entrance to the palace, the game switches to a side-scrolling perspective, in which the player moves towards their goal on foot (by walking, crouching, and climbing ladders, as well jumping) until reaching the boss at the end, in which the player character will begin to fly with their wings again. In addition to the regular levels there are two optional levels that are accessible from the vertical-scrolling segment: a trap level in which the player is forced to escape from if they're sucked by the giant mechanical face on each area; and a hidden bonus level where the player can obtain various treasure chests to increase their score.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,47823,12632,16468,51485,26848,27209,55752,28029,37094],"tags":[1,17,268435461,268435464,268435489,536871078,536871208,536875879,536876296,1073741828,1073741827],"developers":[37],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3,4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[166,296,4967,5384],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[5,8,33],"first_release_date":533779200000,"platforms":[52,18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":583718400000,"region":2,"human":"1988-Jul-01","y":1988,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":533779200000,"region":5,"human":"1986-Dec-01","y":1986,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cda3qklbiwtcbfijtqpk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cda3qklbiwtcbfijtqpk","width":256,"height":224}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o3dtitffof2js0yngtkf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o3dtitffof2js0yngtkf","width":437,"height":600},"esrb":{"rating":1}},{"id":39706,"name":"Lizard Wizard","slug":"lizard-wizard","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lizard-wizard","created_at":1498137583548,"updated_at":1500228686923,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nhrhaqj42lmp1ypqkupj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nhrhaqj42lmp1ypqkupj","width":840,"height":1080}]},{"id":39707,"name":"Mach Breakers","slug":"mach-breakers","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mach-breakers","created_at":1498137750195,"updated_at":1516560510391,"summary":"Mach Breakers: Numan Athletics 2 is a sports arcade game that was released by Namco in 1994 only in Japan; it runs on Namco NB-2 hardware and is the sequel to Numan Athletics, which was released in the previous year.","collection":5295,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,22690,11253,25311,68287,71455,25300,36950,15851,39966],"tags":[1,18,268435470,536871186,536872078,536875240],"category":0,"keywords":[274,1166,4328],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":790646400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":790646400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jan-21","y":1995,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ialupmhsaa1nncwgsyek.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ialupmhsaa1nncwgsyek","width":1080,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p3lw8uceevkcgyxcbavk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p3lw8uceevkcgyxcbavk","width":850,"height":1204}},{"id":39708,"name":"Macross II","slug":"macross-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/macross-ii","created_at":1498137752613,"updated_at":1512724607343,"summary":"In 1999, an alien ship crashes on South Atalia Island and makes the human race aware of other life in space.

The game begins in the summer of 1845 when Thoreau moved to the Pond and built his cabin there.  \n \nPlayers follow in his footsteps, surviving in the woods by finding food and fuel and maintaining their shelter and clothing. At the same time, players are surrounded by the beauty of the woods and the Pond, which hold a promise of a sublime life beyond these basic needs. The game follows the loose narrative of Thoreau’s first year in the woods, with each season holding its own challenges for survival and possibilities for inspiration.  \n \nThe audience for the game is broad: from experimental game players to lovers of Thoreau and Transcendental literature. As such, the game offers more opportunities for reflective play than strategic challenge. The piece has a subtle narrative arc, in homage to the original text, which is not an adventure of the body pitted against nature, but of the mind and soul living in nature over the course of a New England year.  \n \nWe have just opened a quiet early access alpha on Itch.io if you'd like to play now and give feedback. For those of you asking why we haven't updated this site in a while ... well, we've been very busy building a six-hour open world game with a tiny team of developers! But, we're really close now and are looking forward to releasing the final version in time for the 200th anniversary of Thoreau's birth this year.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28465,34919,33603,36962,55888,65827,16468,40524,27266,28277],"tags":[268435488,536871415,536873491],"category":0,"keywords":[503,2579],"genres":[32],"status":4,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":14,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":6,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/knsjbcev2nn56n3ya7g0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"knsjbcev2nn56n3ya7g0","width":640,"height":360}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"eoc8OnYvZfw"}],"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://waldengame.com/"}]},{"id":39748,"name":"Tracks: The Train Set Game","slug":"tracks-the-train-set-game","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tracks-the-train-set-game","created_at":1498199233661,"updated_at":1516564067625,"summary":"Build the train sets of your childhood dreams with an easy-to-use editor.

What makes this game unique is that the game gives players the opportunity to allow players to use their obtained weapons (save for the hand grenades) as melee weapons which helps conserve ammunition for when it's needed.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,10039,1188,51485,26848,36608,74863,34919,27239],"tags":[1,268435464,536876685,536883347],"category":0,"keywords":[5773,12435],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/smpjb5ar83vpjwhauny5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"smpjb5ar83vpjwhauny5","width":545,"height":767}},{"id":39889,"name":"Ninja Combat","slug":"ninja-combat","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ninja-combat","created_at":1498464317557,"updated_at":1518075800844,"summary":"Ninja Combat (ニンジャコンバット?)

Sasaki went by the fighting name of Ganryū, hence the game's name \"Ganryu Musashi\". \n \nThe game's selectable characters are the samurai swordsman Miyamoto Musashi and his female kunoichi counterpart Suzume. The mission of the game is to rescue Musashi's love Otsu from a clan of evil ninja led by Kojiro Sasaki. Players are armed with a sword (katana for Musashi/kaiken for Suzume) and a grappling claw. The claw serves as a long-range weapon, and can act as a grapnel in certain settings to reach higher ground or ascend over chasms. A powerful projectile attack can also be achieved by holding down the attack button, although this takes time to charge. Additional temporary weapons can be found throughout the game, such as shuriken for Musashi, kunai for Suzume, and an \"energy ball\" weapon. Upon rescuing hostages, rewards are given to the player in form of food (onigiri, takoyaki), which can restore health, or ryo coins for extra points.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[19289,13189,25222,22425,41895,55803,26766,11296,29730,51485],"tags":[268435464,268435487,536871244,536871939,536872617,536875054,536875075,536875081,536875151],"category":0,"keywords":[332,1027,1705,4142,4163,4169,4239],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":915148800000,"platforms":[80,52,79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":915148800000,"region":2,"human":"1999-Jan-01","y":1999,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":946684800000,"region":2,"human":"2000-Jan-01","y":2000,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":915148800000,"region":5,"human":"1999-Jan-01","y":1999,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":917827200000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Feb-01","y":1999,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/syjxojnda6h4lamw7abm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"syjxojnda6h4lamw7abm","width":850,"height":1138}},{"id":39892,"name":"Tazz-Mania","slug":"tazz-mania","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tazz-mania","created_at":1498464325103,"updated_at":1500231962697,"summary":"You control a Q*bert-style character with a machine gun.

The basic goal of each level is to get to the end, but the way you get there is anything but a straight line. Your plane (which can go in any direction, pulling off loop-de-loops and such at will) has a constantly depleting fuel gauge, forcing you to do one of two things: you can shoot down other planes to refill some fuel, or you can jump out of your plane and try to hijack one from an enemy. You only have a couple of parachutes, though, so you have to be careful - if you miss your shot and don't have any left, you'll go splat. If you do have a parachute (which you can earn more of by shooting down a certain number of enemies from the same wave) you'll glide down and have to face various hazards on the road while you search for a new plane. It's refreshing how open-ended the game is laid out. Although your destination lies all the way to the right of the stage, you have free reign to go wherever you please. If you stay close to the ground you'll avoid enemies, but that also means that you'll be out of luck when you run out of fuel (which happens quickly, especially if you're using turbo). Or, you could go high and get into some seriously intense dog-fights, or even backtrack if you missed a wave of cool looking planes you want to hijack. Other decisions you have to make are based around the fuel gauge, which decreases extremely quickly. Do you focus on shooting other planes, or go the more risky route by trying to hijack? The former is usually the safe bet, but it's incredibly fun to try out all the new planes being thrown your way. You have to be careful, though, as hijacking different enemies produces different effects. While other planes are typically a safe bet, other enemies are sometimes not. For example, trying to hijack the flying pigs results in you either wasting a parachute or falling to your death, and UFO's zap you if you try to get on them. Though there isn't as much variety in the levels as I would like, there are constantly new enemies thrown at you, which are really the star of the show anyway. Through and through the action stays frantic and intense, with some opportunities for some really memorable moments. It's a perfect example of the easy to pick up, hard to master philosophy of game design. Newcomers can have a blast even when they're dying every twenty seconds, and it's an absolute blast trying to perfect your game. While I'm not usually into self-imposed challenges, it's super fun trying to finish a level without dying and keeping the same plane. Graphically, the game is astounding for 1984, and still serves the game nicely today. The colors are very bright and vivid, the cartoony art style is great, and everything moves at a brisk pace. The audio design don't fare as well, though - get ready for a lot of bleeps and bloops. One other thing to note is that, unlike so many games of the era, you don't have to start over at the beginning when you die. Instead, you start right back from where you left off. I can't express how delighted I was to find that out, because although it might be \"hardcore\", it simply sucks having to replay the beginning over and over again in other games. It might be a bit obscure, and it's not perfect, but as far as I'm concerned Acrobatic Dog-Fight is a classic and an absolute must-play. \n \nTRIVIA \nAntonio Colangelo of Senago, Italy holds the official record for this game with 1,445,050 points on July 17, 1985.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":444441600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":444441600000,"region":8,"human":"1984-Feb-01","y":1984,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vqj8gvrq46h1cd5efrr2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vqj8gvrq46h1cd5efrr2","width":801,"height":1134}},{"id":39972,"name":"Gun Lock","slug":"gun-lock","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gun-lock","created_at":1498466152607,"updated_at":1515818982867,"summary":"Gun Loco was an Xbox 360-exclusive shooter in development at Square Enix Europe which has been canceled.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,11588,28113,76098,19083,7329,51464,68279,74161,36781],"tags":[27,268435461,536871262,536871937,536875358,536875437,536876252,536877497,536883336],"category":0,"keywords":[350,1025,4446,4525,5340,6585,12424],"themes":[27],"genres":[5],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bnsgwuhxkpfyrd7ycjpg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bnsgwuhxkpfyrd7ycjpg","width":850,"height":1187}},{"id":39973,"name":"Gekirindan","slug":"gekirindan","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gekirindan","created_at":1498466155120,"updated_at":1515799277737,"summary":"Gekirindan is a vertical shoot-'em-up by Taito where players select one of three different fighters against an army of mechs through different time periods.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10209,10213,10210,10212,28029,87818,46356,41633,40986,40257],"tags":[268435461,536871078],"category":0,"keywords":[166],"genres":[5],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/csmznzirnvyo5szupu8o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"csmznzirnvyo5szupu8o","width":640,"height":640}},{"id":39974,"name":"Space Fever","slug":"space-fever","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/space-fever","created_at":1498466164722,"updated_at":1516746833094,"summary":"Shoot aliens as they move across the screen.

Each jet may also activate the shield manually in times of trouble. \nWeapons \n \nPlayers have a choice between four different standard pick-up weapons: Vulcan – the player's default weapon which fires straight forward, but can flare out to destroy larger groups of enemies depending on the jet selected. Bombs – a straight firing, explosive weapon that retains the same firing pattern for all jets, but increases in launch count (number of times it can be fired at once) when upgraded. Defender – an explosive cluster-shot weapon that encircles the player's jet and remains the same when upgraded, but increases in count much like the Bombs. Missiles – homing missiles that fire from multiple directions of the jet. Similar to the Vulcan, the Missiles fire in different directions depending on the jet that is used. \n \nEvery jet is equipped with a roll device that allows them to kamikaze safely into other jets. The roll must be re-charged after every use. Players also have the choice to pick up the S-Unit, a weapon attachment that empowers the jet's firing no matter what weapon is picked-up previously and every jet's S-Unit attack differs from the others. Once the S-Unit is equipped, the player cannot use their previous weapons unless the S-Unit is detonated. Detonating the S-Unit does not harm the player, but it does harm the enemy as the unit will detonate in a large and powerful explosion.","collection":4016,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,27314,64204,28029,10209,26766,25300,11253,71455],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871213,536871882,536872733,536873753,536874398,536874745,536875871,536875879,536876120,536880481,536883347],"category":0,"keywords":[166,301,970,1821,2841,3486,3833,4959,4967,5208,9569,12435],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":602294400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":602294400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Feb-01","y":1989,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Kuhga: Operation Code Vapor Trail","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bedfjmrzhv25tky2xgcc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bedfjmrzhv25tky2xgcc","width":850,"height":1101},"esrb":{"rating":1}},{"id":39997,"name":"Vimana","slug":"vimana","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/vimana","created_at":1498466704135,"updated_at":1515576865717,"summary":"Vimana is one of Toaplan's most unique shooters. The level design is particularly creative, along with a unique charge shot and bombs. It gets its name from the Sanskrit word for \"Flying Machine\", described in Sanskrit Epics. The storyline involves a planet being attacked by seemingly indestructible alien forces that induce fear and insanity to all that oppose them. The last hope for this planet is the Vimana Warriors, two ships that are empowered by the Hindu god Ganesha to defend against the aliens and restore peace to the galaxy. \n \nThe Vimana warriors are the player one and player two ships, each equipped with a shot that charges in the shape of a V. Once the shot is released, the V shape explodes forth in an arc, hitting almost everything in front of it. This sounds like it would be a very powerful weapon, but this leads to Vimana's main problem - none of your attacks ever do enough damage. Even the weakest enemies will take more than a few hits to destroy, even if your weapon is fully powered up. Bombs are similarly underwhelming, consisting of seven balls of light that rotate around your ship and guard you from shots. Once an enemy comes onto screen, a light ball will jump out from the group and crash into the enemy, likely destroying or heavily damaging it. Unlike in Fire Shark, where you can pick up new weapons, Vimana does not offer any weapons other than standard shots, charge shots, and bombs. \n \nVimana has some bits of creativity in its levels. One in particular has moving enemy searchlights, which will fire hard to dodge bullets if it spots you. An interesting boss fires from the bottom of the screen as opposed to the top. Vimana also attempts to squeeze around 50 enemy bullets on screen at once, making it feel like a sort of prototype bullet hell shooter. \n \nVimana was never ported to any home systems, but like Out Zone it would not have really fit onto any of them very well. The music was done by Toshiaki Tomizawa, who would later go on to make soundtracks for Fixeight, another Toaplan shooter and many of Cave's games, including Dodonpachi, Progear, Guwange, and ESP Ra.

All schemes have speed-up and multiples (Options), but have differing 'Missile', 'Double' (laser), and 'Laser' weapons. The player can have at most four multiples. Additionally, there are also two types of shielding to choose from: shield and forcefield. The shield option adds more durability, but only for the front of the Vic Viper, while the forcefield adds protection for the entire spacecraft, albeit only against three hits.

Where Scramble has a progress bar at the top, Mega Zone gives the player a map, and shows the player the progress along the map between lives. The main enemies of Mega Zone are giant robot eyeballs. Easily enough destroyed, they still pose a menace. Smaller eyeballs leave teardrops when destroyed, which when picked up, give bonus points and wipe out all enemies on the screen.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[78756,56842,21062,1593,2933,78,1905,1887,7364,26766],"tags":[536870969,536871138,536871139,536871244,536871872,536872587,536872978,536874398,536875074,536875093,536875151,536875154,536875265,536875281,536875367,536875370,536875406,536875433,536875463,536875470,536875677,536876211,536876259,536876266,536876332,536877730,536878462],"category":0},{"id":40007,"name":"Lunar Rescue","slug":"lunar-rescue","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lunar-rescue","created_at":1498466760242,"updated_at":1516571448845,"summary":"The game starts with the player's spacecraft docked inside the mothership at the top of the screen.

The cabinet also provides the players with bells and horns, although these have no use in the actual game.","rating":80.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":80.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[40470,28856,55192,54789,23314,51691,36662,25443,18699,14857],"tags":[268435466,536872030,536875069,536877325],"category":0,"keywords":[1118,4157,6413],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1325721600000,"platforms":[39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1325721600000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Jan-05","y":2012,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Smokey Joe","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/didwoz02m9m7obpdidcc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"didwoz02m9m7obpdidcc","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rsa4nic3utnmfo6uyzpe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rsa4nic3utnmfo6uyzpe","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zdwhkkpfbeb7simbtyoq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zdwhkkpfbeb7simbtyoq","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/meeutcleiukwva6o6mts.jpg","cloudinary_id":"meeutcleiukwva6o6mts","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/udu8brrky2ny4xojwyhu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"udu8brrky2ny4xojwyhu","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cert0gaosvw0d07ib2f4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cert0gaosvw0d07ib2f4","width":406,"height":228},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bwwuimpoectpzroi8gt1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bwwuimpoectpzroi8gt1","width":406,"height":228},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/frwxjpittxnaityxmnxl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"frwxjpittxnaityxmnxl","width":406,"height":228},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bakjqkcr1m4bmom7489w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bakjqkcr1m4bmom7489w","width":406,"height":228},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wp2eegsa0aj0dxas2s72.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wp2eegsa0aj0dxas2s72","width":406,"height":228}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nretxz5xj8rxebfewlb4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nretxz5xj8rxebfewlb4","width":850,"height":1107},"esrb":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":10,"url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fire-truck/id491759799?mt=8\u0026uo=4"}]},{"id":40040,"name":"Finalizer - Super Transformation","slug":"finalizer-super-transformation","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/finalizer-super-transformation","created_at":1498469116767,"updated_at":1515794948280,"summary":"The player starts out as a ship fighting over North America.

In addition, there are also various items hidden beneath barrels in each level which will give Momotaro bonus points. Every floor of the ship has a set number of pirates to be destroyed, as well as a single \"Bow\", a special pirate that regenerates each time it is defeated. Every fourth level in the game yields a bonus level in which the barrels are worth an increased number of points, and a group of enemies entirely made up of Bows (which do not regenerate in this case). With each successive floor, the speed and intelligence of the pirates increases. For every sixteen barrels Momotaro destroys, he will be rewarded with an item that grants invincibility for a limited amount of time, allowing him to defeat enemies by simply touching them. Momotaro's enemies do not have attacks, but a single touch from an enemy will cause him to die and be revived, costing the player one of his/her extra lives; the game will be over when he or she has no more lives. The game has no ending, but following the sixteenth level, the enemy patterns will reset to level one. The layout of the barrels on the stages will continue to change, however, and the enemy count per level will not reset to level one counts. Following level 16, the game may Kill screen at the start of a level or after losing a life.","collection":4315,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[59516,27314,13189,23175,26914,19448,22425,55289,25222,25311],"tags":[1,268435487,536870916,536871939,536875286,536875485,536875666,536875792,536876348,536876713,536880511],"category":0,"keywords":[4,1027,4374,4573,4754,4880,5436,5801,9599],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rtpgk1lxyph5nt84acyh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rtpgk1lxyph5nt84acyh","width":250,"height":199}},{"id":40093,"name":"Jurassic Park 3","slug":"jurassic-park-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jurassic-park-3","created_at":1498473466926,"updated_at":1515858426089,"summary":"A light-gun game for the arcades.

The A and B buttons determine whether your shot is red or blue. If your shot is the same color as the ghosts it hits, it will cut through them like in a bonus level of Alleyway. If it's the opposite color, it will bounce off without doing damage. You can switch as often as you like (even while the ball is bouncing around) so if there are a lot of red ghosts surrounded by a layer of blue ghosts, you could detach all of them from the top of the screen by throwing a blue shot to pass through the outer layer, switching to red to move through the middle, and then switching back to blue to pass out the other side, dropping the majority of the ghosts and putting a lot of garbage on your opponent's screen. As your ball bounces around you're free to move your character back and forth along the bottom of the screen, and you need to catch the ball when it comes back or suffer the penalty of having the pieces lower one notch. \n \nThe action is fast-paced and smooth. The lighthearted characters and rockabilly music add a lot of charm that is missing from newer puzzle games like Lumines and Planet Puzzle League.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"category":0,"first_release_date":1072915200000,"platforms":[80,79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":1072915200000,"region":2,"human":"2004-Jan-01","y":2004,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":1072915200000,"region":2,"human":"2004-Jan-01","y":2004,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":1072915200000,"region":5,"human":"2004-Jan-01","y":2004,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":1072915200000,"region":5,"human":"2004-Jan-01","y":2004,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/txokn223xhkdse371o1i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"txokn223xhkdse371o1i","width":394,"height":518}},{"id":40127,"name":"Pocket Gal Deluxe","slug":"pocket-gal-deluxe","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pocket-gal-deluxe","created_at":1498473885254,"updated_at":1500238059295,"summary":"Pocket Gal Deluxe was produced by Nihon Bussan/AV Japan in 1992. \n \nNihon Bussan/AV Japan released 61 different machines in our database under this trade name, starting in 1978. \n \nOther machines made by Nihon Bussan/AV Japan during the time period Pocket Gal Deluxe was produced include Nitroball, Mahjong La Man, Miracle Adventure, Street Slam, Locked 'N Loaded, China Town, Super BurgerTime, Out Fencer, Secret Agent, and Midnight Resistance.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[11362,9760,33603,36962,55888,73075,65827,2015,32283,75065],"tags":[268435470,268435471],"category":0,"genres":[14,15],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tmt06clhmei0n3lxx6mj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tmt06clhmei0n3lxx6mj","width":800,"height":600}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k2nlwjxkziwubewg7162.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k2nlwjxkziwubewg7162","width":850,"height":1210}},{"id":40128,"name":"GALS PINBALL","slug":"gals-pinball","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gals-pinball","created_at":1498473888097,"updated_at":1500236301478,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vedf63aitmlw0x4zhmt2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vedf63aitmlw0x4zhmt2","width":850,"height":1060}},{"id":40129,"name":"Capcom baseball","slug":"capcom-baseball","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/capcom-baseball","created_at":1498473890952,"updated_at":1500238063086,"summary":"Capcom Baseball is a baseball arcade game created by Capcom in 1989.

It is incredible how many elements from other games are squeezed into a surprisingly fun melange platformer. Hard Head (and his twin in 2-player mode) carries a bubble gun that encloses enemies into bubbles, which can then be used as trampoline, just like in Bubble Bobble. Similar to Super Mario Bros, items are gained from blocks by jumping at them with the hero's head, while enemies are defeated by stepping on theirs. Then there's passages where one has to break through walls by using a hammer, which is very reminiscent of Wrecking Crew. \n \nHowever, other than with contemporary titles of home entertainment companies like Clover and Zemina, the designer (who sadly isn't credited at all) had also a few quite unique ideas, like working musical instruments used as platforms, a football that can be found in every stage and kicked through a goal at the level end for extra points. There even is a day/night change hinted at through pallette rotation of the mostly monocoloured background. The game has a time limit, but rather than just killing the player off when it runs out, more and more evil suns come attacking the player already when only little time is left. \n \nThe game can be enjoyed by two players simultaneously, who can use each other's head as a springboard to reach higher places without relying on nearby enemies. Only in the second half the game tends to get a bit tedious, as there's almost no new elements introduced after the middle, and those from the early stages grow old fast because of their steady repetition.

One day, Nyan questions the Chinese Zodiac and wonders why a cat isn't part of the zodiac while others like the dog and monkey are.

Visually, the game is pretty good and doesn't do anything over-the-top, but still manages to be pretty decent for the genre. The audio is okay; I don't have any qualms with it, but nothing really jumps out at me (the music is geared for the kids). It's not necessarily my cup of tea, but it isn't necessarily bad (I have different tastes in music). \n \nKEM plays like many other drop puzzlers in the general sense; you match three blocks and they disappear. You can create chains and drop big piles of junk on your opponent. To destroy said junk and get your breathing room back, you must match blocks that are touching the junk. When you do so, the blocks and junk next to it will both vanish. KEM does have a trick up its sleeve; orbs that when matched, destroy all treasure boxes (just another type of block that you can chain with) as well as any orbs you didn't match that are scattered on your screen. By matching three orbs together when your screen is full of blocks, you can cause massive chain reactions or massive gatherings of blocks to be destroyed all at once. Naturally, you will deal a huge blow to your adversary when you do this so timing is essential (and the opponent can too so watch out!). \n \nAt any rate, KEM is a pretty decent game to play with silly characters and decent audio/visuals.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":762480000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":762480000000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Mar-01","y":1994,"m":3}]},{"id":40230,"name":"Koi No Hotrock","slug":"koi-no-hotrock","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/koi-no-hotrock","created_at":1498476756961,"updated_at":1500237804331,"summary":"Rock band members try to save the female vocal who has been abducted.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":510019200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":510019200000,"region":8,"human":"1986-Mar-01","y":1986,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jcxz69hovxrp3gitmu6h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jcxz69hovxrp3gitmu6h","width":836,"height":1190}},{"id":40231,"name":"Knock Out!!","slug":"knock-out","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/knock-out","created_at":1498476759590,"updated_at":1516668959115,"summary":"A maze game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,48273,36608,34919,19222,16468,23175,40524,27266,2969],"tags":[1,268435465,536875071],"category":0,"keywords":[4159],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":383788800000,"platforms":[52,93],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":93,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985-Dec-31","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":383788800000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Mar-01","y":1982,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super Breakout","comment":"Other"},{"name":"The Wall","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Knockout ","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xdrc2nclcdxrhtr2k29m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xdrc2nclcdxrhtr2k29m","width":462,"height":693}},{"id":40232,"name":"Car Jamboree","slug":"car-jamboree","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/car-jamboree","created_at":1498476760489,"updated_at":1515643883564,"summary":"A driving demolition game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,40524,28004,23314,23175,28856,16468,1070,2940],"tags":[1,268435466],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}]},{"id":40233,"name":"Big Fight: Big Trouble in the Atlantic Ocean","slug":"big-fight-big-trouble-in-the-atlantic-ocean","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/big-fight-big-trouble-in-the-atlantic-ocean","created_at":1498476763003,"updated_at":1500237769697,"summary":"Big Fight (ビッグファイト?), fully titled as Big Fight: Big Trouble in the Atlantic Ocean, is a 1992 fighting game / belt scrolling beat 'em up-hybrid arcade game developed and published by Tatsumi, and is one of their last arcade games before focusing on novelty sticker printing business.

It was \"feed me all your quarters\" hard and pretty much unplayable, but contributed one exciting new element: you could jump into war vehicules and used them against the enemy. Most of you probably didn't even know that it had a sequel. Gun Force 2 was one of the last arcade games (if not the last one) from Irem Corp., published in 1994. When looking at the screenshots, the game's similarity to Metal Slug becomes evident immediately. Yes, Metal Slug is an evolution of this game, as the staff members are actually the same. When Irem Corp. ceased activity, a group of its staff members got together and founded Nazca Corp. They revived their last idea, pumping it up and calling it Metal Slug on the Neo Geo system. \n \nGun Force 2 is easier and even more enjoyable than Metal Slug. You won't need a dozen quarters to finish it. It's much friendlier and more replayable, but there's less to see and find through out the whole game, as it's just not as technically complex as its modern brother. \n \nYour character is equipped with two guns at the same time that can aim in any direction, at a slightly different angle each. Different weapons are available but only one of your guns can be upgraded, with the other one always keeping the basic shot. There aren't any bombs or grenades, though. Our hero can jump, crouch and hang from ceilings and wires, and also use one of eleven (yes, eleven) war vehicules. This is why Gun Force 2 is so cool. Engaging the enemy with bipedal walkers, jeeps, tanks, and even a Gundam-like flying suit provides such a fuzzy and trigger-happy feeling. Your objective in every level is to rescue hostages for higher scores, which was also later taken over by Metal Slug. Luckily, they are sexy half-dressed cuties instead of Robinson Crusoe's look-a-likes, but they won't leave any rewards or power-ups behind. \n \nPlot-wise, Metal Slug and Gun Force are not related, although you fight off mutants, soldiers and aliens in both games. But technically they are almost identical, utilizing the same graphic design and color palette for backgrounds, explosions and vehicles. There's lots of metal and shrapnel flying everywhere following the extremely well animated explosions (which, interestingly enough, also causes slowdown here). The characters are less cartoonish than Metal Slug. They look more menacing and cool, except for the goofy looking hero, who looks like his arms are going to fall off from carrying those two huge guns. All of the sprites are fluidly animated, with huge mechanical bosses and mini-bosses that perform various attack sequences, with the ability to destroy parts of the background too. The music is just repetitive and bland, but what's interesting is that some of it was first used in another Irem game. They are remixed versions of stages 1, 3 and 4 of Air Duel. Some weapon samples and sound effects are exactly the same as in Metal Slug. \n \nGun Force 2 looks nothing like its predecessor. The graphic design, playability and animation has completely changed and it's improved in every point. An excellent last arcade jewel from Irem even if you are not a Metal Slug fan, and if you are, do yourself a favor and catch up on the game's roots. You shouldn't miss this.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/twp81ic0zziwryiknq81.jpg","cloudinary_id":"twp81ic0zziwryiknq81","width":850,"height":1201}},{"id":40235,"name":"Bang Bead","slug":"bang-bead","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bang-bead","created_at":1498476767594,"updated_at":1515720406214,"summary":"Bang Bead is a pong-esq arcade game released in 2000 by Visco Corp.

It's actually a strange, overhead shooter much like Robotron. The star is the titular Performan, a native in a jungle that wears a huge mask, who's being stalked by a squadron of drill-wielding robots. He must stop them using balls of energy, his ability to dig underground, and bombs that are set up in every level. He can also go into Power Mode by shooting ghosts that randomly appear, which turns him green and invincible for a short time. \n \nNeedless to say, Performan is a very weird, very hard game. There are 99 levels and the game loops endlessly, as typical of most early arcade games. The main problem with Performan is that he's far too weak to survive for long. He can't move quickly, his shots are slow, and he can only have one shot on screen at a time, which can easily be dodged. The bombs are an easy way to get rid of two or maybe three at a time, but this usually requires setup, which takes a bit time, and by which point you're like to be killed.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":486432000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":486432000000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Jun-01","y":1985,"m":6}]},{"id":40406,"name":"Penguin Brothers","slug":"penguin-brothers","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/penguin-brothers","created_at":1498479555519,"updated_at":1516578430894,"summary":"A multi-screen platform game where the players controls penguins fighting against various enemies.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,36608,34919,19222,16468,23175,40524,27266,2969,37094],"tags":[1,268435465,536872282],"category":0,"keywords":[1370],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":959817600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":959817600000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jun-01","y":2000,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hvbiu95cthhdw9tncmgd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hvbiu95cthhdw9tncmgd","width":320,"height":224}},{"id":40407,"name":"Peek-a-Boo!","slug":"peek-a-boo","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/peek-a-boo","created_at":1498479557511,"updated_at":1500239703965,"summary":"Move a paddle left and right to prevent a bouncing ball from escaping the screen at the botton.

At their base, these games were akin to shoot-em-ups, except they didn't take place in airplanes or starcrafts as was the norm of the time. Most of them did not scroll automatically and allowed the player a bit more breathing room hence, but they still pressured players with lots of bullets and aggressive enemies. Most big companies offered at least one top-down on-foot shooter, Sega naturally included. Their best-known contribution to that front in the eighties was Alien Syndrome, their tribute to the Alien series which involves two soldiers destroying frightening xenomorphs on derelict vessels.

The hero of the game, Jack, must make his way through 16 levels of a pyramid in order to defeat the demon Belzebut and rescue the royal Pamera family.Each level is split into two parts an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from the games prequel, Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the games timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.To prevent the player from becoming too greedy, the game automatically sends the player to a Torture Room if they obtain more than 9 Mighty Coins or 99 seconds on the games timer. The only way to escape a Torture Room without losing a life is to complete a number of jumps, which are counted down on the screen. Once the player exits the torture room, Jack automatically loses all Mighty Coins, the timer is reset to 60 seconds, and the game recommences from the beginning of the current level.A Royal Palace room NES version.A Vs. Series version of the game was released in 1986 for the Japanese market not to be confused with the original dedicated arcade version. Differences between the original and vs. series versions include adding a two-player mode, changing the locations of some secret passages and removing a warp trick in the Royal Palace rooms. In the NES version, Jack could warp forward to the next Royal Palace room if he touched the first lit bomb in the current room after the other 23 bombs were collected however, if Jack died in the warping process, he would be sent back to the beginning of the level from which the trick commenced.Mighty Bomb Jack also had a guest appearance on Tecmo Super Bowl, during the halftime show in the Super Bowl","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"publishers":[14776],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":517968000000,"platforms":[52,41,37,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1391558400000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Feb-05","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1395878400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Mar-27","y":2014,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1390435200000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Jan-23","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1170720000000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Feb-06","y":2007,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1178496000000,"region":2,"human":"2007-May-07","y":2007,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1177632000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Apr-27","y":2007,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1348617600000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Sep-26","y":2012,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1354752000000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Dec-06","y":2012,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1351123200000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Oct-25","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":517968000000,"region":8,"human":"1986-Jun-01","y":1986,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fxftzkuflqfgnu6imban.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fxftzkuflqfgnu6imban","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/derwxpmavznz7duowgyp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"derwxpmavznz7duowgyp","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hg9hswkboyle0v1zocld.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hg9hswkboyle0v1zocld","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bvrsl4lyj3rtgs04shto.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bvrsl4lyj3rtgs04shto","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rqj51t3wre0fsdglgy9l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rqj51t3wre0fsdglgy9l","width":256,"height":240}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/anvryvrkgqcnnduzhquo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"anvryvrkgqcnnduzhquo","width":516,"height":733}},{"id":40532,"name":"Wai Wai Jockey Gate-In!","slug":"wai-wai-jockey-gate-in","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wai-wai-jockey-gate-in","created_at":1498480875816,"updated_at":1500241350197,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":454896000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":454896000000,"region":8,"human":"1984-Jun-01","y":1984,"m":6}]},{"id":40533,"name":"Vs.

An enormous laser-eyed space serpent is coiled around the mountain, and you have to take it down single-handedly. Once See the videoyou’ve baked the snake, you land your sled on the surface and have a shootout with Gryptogg, Raygoth and Arkus. Once you’ve beaten them back, you can explore the underground caverns, collecting their instruments of evil and exchanging fire with them again. When you escape from their maze, you advance to the next level and begin the fight anew. (North American Philips / Probe 2000, 1983 – unreleased) \n \nThis Colecovision adaptation of the Odyssey2 game (now there’s a phrase you’re never going to see again), based on a less-than-blockbuster-successful series of comics and action figures, adds more depth to the game than the dear old Odyssey ever could’ve managed. But it’s hard to tell how much depth, as the game was never completed. \n \nThe “snake” screen, though it’s much more impressive visually than its counterpart on the Odyssey2, is just plain boring. The O2 edition of Power Lords also forced you to dodge earthbound meteors and an “artificial black hole” within the volcano that could drag you to your doom if you got on a horizontal line of sight with it when it opened. On the Colecovision, all you have to contend with are enemy vehicles and a slow-moving snake. It takes more time than effort to clear this screen, and it’s ultimately a bit boring. \n \nThe other screens, which aren’t even hinted at in the Odyssey2 version of the game, are also a bit tedious – enemy A.I. and combat programming obviously weren’t finished when the game was abandoned. You can exchange fire with your interestingly-animated opponents, but sometimes they just stop firing and disappear. Convenient, sure, but not terribly exciting. \n \n“Probe 2000” was an imprint – akin to Atari’s “Atarisoft” division – opened by North American Philips to release games for hardware other than the Odyssey2, which was by now firmly into its twilight. The only game actually released by Probe 2000 was War Room, programmed by Bob “RoSHa” Harris (who created Killer Bees on the O2). Probe 2000’s next release would’ve been either Power Lords or the impressive RPG Lord Of The Dungeon (which was left in limbo because its battery-backed-up cartridge, capable of saving the player’s position, was an idea that just wouldn’t be practical until the NES era). The intellectual property rights to Pink Panther had been snagged by N.A.P. for the Odyssey2 and other systems, but the only version of that game that has ever surfaced has been an incredibly rare Atari 2600 prototype. N.A.P. ultimately got out of the game business, leaving both the Odyssey2 and Probe 2000 behind.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[68],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":68,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zr7tnv39z3ovc9gk6eod.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zr7tnv39z3ovc9gk6eod","width":1081,"height":791}},{"id":40925,"name":"Ms. Space Fury","slug":"ms-space-fury","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ms-space-fury","created_at":1498490113138,"updated_at":1500254476350,"summary":"This years’ Classic Gaming Expo and the 10th Anniversary of Digital Press happen to coincide. Obviously, DP wanted to do something special to mark the occasion. What better way than to release an original game for a classic system? Several game developers were contacted, but the job went to Daniel Bienvenu, who had written a few homebrews for ColecoVision (BUSTin Out, Dac-Man). Joe Santulli came up with the title and concept and provided support. A lot of people pitched in to help. Daniel brought in Sylvain (‘Sly DC’) De Chantal to design most of the levels and assist with the graphics. Marcel de Kogel wrote the emulator the game was compiled and tested on. As the project neared completion, Dave Giarrusso designed the artwork for the label and the instruction manual (as well as the full page advertisement shown in the last issue of DP as well as the CGE2K1 show program). Even veteran homebrew author John Dondzila lent his expertise on coding and debugging the program. Most of the communication and brainstorming was done via the Internet through email and instant messenger—something the designers of old didn’t have at their disposal. \n \nFinally, when the game was complete there were ten levels. After the game was downloaded to a ROM, it was discovered that it wouldn’t load an the actual console! After nearly giving coordinator Santulli a heart attack, John Dondzila was consulted and solved the problem. During his testing there were issues that had to be addressed such as heavy flickering and fatal errors. These were eventually worked out, and Santulli survived from near-coronary condition. Ironically when the bugs were fixed it freed up a lot of storage, so an additional ten levels were eventually added. There was not much time left but Santulli, with the aid of fellow CGE organizer and DP guy John Hardie managed to do the soldering and construction of 40 cartridges in time for a Classic Gaming Expo release. \n \nWhen the scheduled release time arrived at the show a long queue had formed. The games sold out within ten minutes. Even the promotional posters (with Dave G’s artwork) were taken. Most Expo-goers managed to at least play the demo that was set up. Their comments were consistently positive.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":980985600000,"platforms":[68],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":68,"date":980985600000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Feb-01","y":2001,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nl8tuzjukzqhpadhidu0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nl8tuzjukzqhpadhidu0","width":1085,"height":793}},{"id":40927,"name":"Fall Guy","slug":"fall-guy","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fall-guy","created_at":1498490118865,"updated_at":1500254450711,"summary":"Based on the hit television series staring Lee Majors and Heather Thomas. \nIn the warehouse screen, when you land on the second floor, go all the way to the LEFT.

Each of the four characters brings along a pet, which can be sent to attack enemies or used as a shield. There are three buttons: Shoot, jump, and shield. Holding the shoot button charges your pet, and when released the pet launches a stationary devastating attack for a few seconds.

This makes it difficult for a trainee nurse such as yourself to bring them under control and it's your job to keep them alive. \n \nEvery time a baby jumps out of its cot, you must chase after it and rescue it from potential harm by picking it up and putting it back into its cot. The hospital ward is on three floors linked by a lift. Babies appear randomly at the left of the screen on any of the floors and crawl towards the right of the screen where, if they survive that long, they will fall down the lift shaft. To rescue the little dears you must run to them, pick them up, run to the nearest cot and put them down. \n \nThe player has three lives, or trainee nurses, to play with. A nurse is fired if too many babies die on a ward. Keep enough babies alive on your ward for long enough and your nurse moves onto the next ward. Advance through sufficient wards and you get another life (a new trainee is assigned to you). Points are awarded for babies picked up and put into their cots and for medicine bottles picked up. Also, to aid you in your task to save the babies you have a gas button that, when pressed, stops all the babies in their tracks while leaving your nurse free to move around. \n \nThe game has three levels of difficulty.

Local people tell of strange creatures that guard vast treasures hidden within the castle, though since no-one who has dared to venture inside has ever returned it's difficult to know how much is fact and how much speculation. \n \nNot too far away from the castle is a small cottage which you may as well use as your base. Though now uninhabited remains in good repair, cared for by the villagers who regard it as a sort of shrine. With luck you may find there some items that will help you in your quest. \n \nThis program loads in three parts, but all you need to do is place the rewound cassette in your tape deck, then tap RUN/STOP while holding down one of the SHIFT keys. The screen will be blank whilst each section loads -- this is quite normal. \n \nAdventure programs offer you a chance to pit your wits against the ingenuity of the author. By instructing the computer to do things (move, examine objects, take objects etc) you must attempt to score as many points as possible. Points are usually scored for finding treasures and other objects, and sometimes for visiting particular places. Adventures can take months to solve, and so the best programs allow you to save the state of the game on cassette so that you can continue your quest another day. \n \nIf this is your first adventure you should try typing INFO which displays useful information. The computer will understand a wide range of words and phrases, but not absolutely everything that you throw at it. Some words are standard throughout most adventures -- NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN, INVENTORY, DROP, TAKE, and SCORE are some of the most common, but you will usually have to experiment to find out just what the computer does understand. And beware, words that are understood in one location may not be understood in another. \n \nQuite complex sentences can be entered, for example, PUT THE RED APPLE IN THE BUCKET. First the program will check that the two objects mentioned are in the room (a room can be any location in the game), then it checks that you're actually holding the APPLE. Whether or not you are holding the BUCKET doesn't matter. It might be that there is more than one BUCKET visible, in which case you should specify the METAL BUCKET, the LARGE BUCKET or whatever. Finally the program will make sure that there is room in the BUCKET for the RED APPLE. \n \nNot all items mentioned in the adventure are objects which can be manipulated. Often they will serve merely to embellish a room description or to give you a hint about the nature of the place that you are in; in this case you will probably be told I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. \n \nAll adventures have mazes. They may not always look like mazes, but if you keep coming back to what seems to be the same place then you are probably in a maze. When you get lost in a maze (as you most certainly will) don't wander about aimlessly, but try to map the maze. TO do this you must be able to distinguish one part of the maze from another -- which usually means dropping some of the objects you are carrying. Of course, you might not ever find them again! \n \nYou can SAVE the state of the game at any time (it's a good idea to do it before doing anything particularly risky). Make sure that you have a blank cassette handy. The command RESTORE allows you to reset the state of the game to one that you have saved previously. \n \n[Note: the box art is from the 1987 'Classic Quests' upgraded version.]","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[47823,25211,26766,41126,26223,36926,18398,36534,43130,27266],"tags":[268435487,536871208,536873308,536875172],"category":0,"keywords":[296,2396,4260],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}]},{"id":41153,"name":"Double Sphere","slug":"double-sphere","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/double-sphere","created_at":1498813385897,"updated_at":1500285477754,"summary":"Double Sphere is a sports game set in space played between two players.

The basic gameplay features the player bouncing a ball off of a paddle into a wall of bricks, chipping them off one brick at a time. Each brick destroyed earns the player points with the low green bricks being worth 1 point each, the middle blue bricks being worth 4 points each, and the red bricks on top rewarding 7 points each. Once the ball bounces off the wall of bricks, it's up to the player to maneuver the paddle under the falling ball in order to hit it back up into the wall of bricks. The player loses a life if he happens to miss hitting the ball with his paddle and it falls into the abyss. The game ends when 7 balls are lost. To keep up with the pinball motif, the wall of bricks are referred to as different colored skill lanes, the walls on the side that the ball can bounce off of are labeled side rails, and the paddle is referred to as a flipper. \n \nThe game offers 132 game variations of this basic gameplay idea, some of them for two simultaneous players. Game modes include Pinball Wiz, Crossover, Blok-Shot, Cooperation, Pro Challenge, and Double Blok, with each having variations that can include different sized paddles, ball speeds, invisible bricks, and even a variation where the paddle shrinks each time it hits the ball.","collection":1634,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":2754,"games":[28029,68287,25311,71455,36794,36608,51485,34919,36950,76722],"tags":[1,18,268435489,1073741827],"developers":[9372],"publishers":[9372],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":257558400000,"platforms":[127],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":127,"date":257558400000,"region":8,"human":"1978-Mar-01","y":1978,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Videocart 15 - Barriere"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fe46syjyonzlzd2cmgu9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fe46syjyonzlzd2cmgu9","width":612,"height":464}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"l0r-3YMxYx0"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rtfpcr34iu7dhpqpyphf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rtfpcr34iu7dhpqpyphf","width":344,"height":462}},{"id":41225,"name":"Videocart-19: Checkers","slug":"videocart-19-checkers","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/videocart-19-checkers","created_at":1498814177146,"updated_at":1515760520420,"summary":"A playable version of the board game of Checkers.

Your goal in each stage is to collect three different diamonds to power your hovercraft to the next area, and many are, naturally, guarded by bosses.","popularity":2.0,"games":[25300,23175,36950,25311,68287,27314,71455,47823,19448,26766],"tags":[1,18,268435487,536871882,536871945,536877133,536877451],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1033,6221,6539],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":546220800000,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":546220800000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Apr-24","y":1987,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":548812800000,"region":8,"human":"1987-May-24","y":1987,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/umsshdnphss3fadrhari.jpg","cloudinary_id":"umsshdnphss3fadrhari","width":924,"height":953}},{"id":41238,"name":"BodyConQuest I: Abakareshi Musume Tachi","slug":"bodyconquest-i-abakareshi-musume-tachi","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bodyconquest-i-abakareshi-musume-tachi","created_at":1498814572999,"updated_at":1500265039889,"summary":"BodyConQuest I - Girls Exposed is an unlicensed, 2 disk, action RPG, Dragon Quest parody by Hacker International for the Famicom Disk system.

One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce of Power. This army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil Ganon.

It varies between observing goofy pet behavior to more abstract tales of fantasy with anthropomorphized versions of the animal characters.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[60044,34218,22481,70861,27266,70332,47806,41435,19567,76592],"tags":[34,268435465,536870990,536871446,536872216,536872407,536875222,536875241],"category":0,"keywords":[78,534,1304,1495,4310,4329],"themes":[34],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":553651200000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":553651200000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Jul-19","y":1987,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pjylyo9jkugrlpupv26c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pjylyo9jkugrlpupv26c","width":949,"height":943}},{"id":41293,"name":"Risa no Yousei Densetsu","slug":"risa-no-yousei-densetsu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/risa-no-yousei-densetsu","created_at":1498815089877,"updated_at":1516757719595,"summary":"You take the role of a boy visiting a concert of popular Japanese idol, singer and actress Risa Tachibana.

He placed a curse upon the prince and transported him far from Felix, to the other end of the world.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[12632,36926,36608,47823,16468,26766,25300,59516,27209,36534],"tags":[1,268435468,536871208,536871938,536878240,536878241],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,7328,7329],"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":544406400000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":544406400000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Apr-03","y":1987,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pj7w7hejmduonn1kg1bf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pj7w7hejmduonn1kg1bf","width":300,"height":332}},{"id":41338,"name":"Eggerland: Souzouhe no Tabidachi","slug":"eggerland-souzouhe-no-tabidachi","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/eggerland-souzouhe-no-tabidachi","created_at":1498815463213,"updated_at":1516755192938,"summary":"Eggerland: Journey to the Creation (Eggerland: Souzou heno Tabidachi) is a part of the Eggerland series.

There are 50 rounds in the game, which is less than the other Eggerland Famicom games. The game is unique out of all the other Eggerland titles for Famicom by allowing the player to create their own levels. \n \nLike the other Eggerland games, the objective of each stage is simple; collect all the heart frames and then collect the orb inside the treasure box to proceed to the next level. It won't be easy though; King Egger has sent forth his enemies to take care of you. Lolo must use certain tactics to get by, such as trapping the enemies or knocking them off the screen temporarily.","collection":1017,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[18167,19934,65832,60044,29173,76731,25311,25222,25646,48510],"tags":[1,268435465,268435471,536871570,536871599,536872407,536873787,536874694,536875639,536875666,536875758,536876930,536879712,536880771,536880772,536880796,1073741827],"developers":[762],"publishers":[762],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[658,687,1495,2875,3782,4727,4754,4846,6018,8800,9859,9860,9884],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":588038400000,"platforms":[51],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":588038400000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Aug-20","y":1988,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Eggerland: Sōzō e no Tabidachi"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zf6llozd9roomxnme3c5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zf6llozd9roomxnme3c5","width":1000,"height":1126}},{"id":41339,"name":"Bishojou Mahjong Club","slug":"bishojou-mahjong-club","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bishojou-mahjong-club","created_at":1498815465547,"updated_at":1500266341575,"summary":"Bishoujo Mahjong Club is a Board / Tabletop - Adult game, developed by Super PIG and published by Mimi-Pro, which was released in Japan in 1988 for the Nintendo Famicom Disk System.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14]},{"id":41340,"name":"Akuu Senki Raijin","slug":"akuu-senki-raijin","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/akuu-senki-raijin","created_at":1498815467011,"updated_at":1516757576161,"summary":"A scrolling mecha shooter published by Squaresoft for the Famicom Disk System. \n \nAkuu Senki Raijin (occasionally transliterated as Akara Senki Raijin) is a vertical shooter where the player controls a mecha that transforms into a starfighter.

It was never released outside of Japan. \n \nThe title of 19 is based on the Greek pantheon of Gods, of which there are nineteen. \"Neunzehn\" is simply the number 19 in German. The player controls one of four heirs with an equal claim to the throne of the Greek hero Achilles. The latter sends the four to procure a magical stone that confers omnipotence to the user, originally left behind by the Greek gods. Through warfare, the player-chosen hero must defeat the armies of their three rivals and claim it for themselves. \n \nGameplay: \nThe game is a war strategy sim, where each player has an army to command and move into battle against other armies. The player starts off at a corner of the world map, depending on which side they chose to lead. Armies can be moved one at a time and once positioned the turn is over, the CPU sides move their units and the next begins. \n \nEncountering an enemy army switches the game to a hexagon-grid field where the goal is to plan out the movement and attacks of the four units under the player's command. However, each turn plays out simultaneously - the enemy moves when the player does, leading to several circumstances where an enemy is no longer standing in a spot that the player has targeted. Rather, the player has to guess based on their best judgement where the computer will move and then intercept them. \n \nThe game ends once every other side has been wiped out: Though the war is predicated on a search for a mystical stone, there is no stone to be found in-game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55036,29173,55590,23345,19376,76731,9760,33603,9199,19934],"tags":[268435471,536873863,536874694,536875472],"category":0,"keywords":[2951,3782,4560],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":573436800000,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":573436800000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Mar-04","y":1988,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":576115200000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Apr-04","y":1988,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jilfrcmyfuoajrwwfzpi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jilfrcmyfuoajrwwfzpi","width":275,"height":304}},{"id":41343,"name":"Lipstick #.4: Hakui no Tenshi Hen","slug":"lipstick-number-dot-4-hakui-no-tenshi-hen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lipstick-number-dot-4-hakui-no-tenshi-hen","created_at":1498815476044,"updated_at":1500266288633,"summary":"A pornographic puzzle game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9]},{"id":41344,"name":"Lipstick #.3: OL Hen","slug":"lipstick-number-dot-3-ol-hen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lipstick-number-dot-3-ol-hen","created_at":1498815477074,"updated_at":1500266280085,"summary":"A pornographic puzzle game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9]},{"id":41345,"name":"Lipstick #.2: Joshi Gakusei Hen","slug":"lipstick-number-dot-2-joshi-gakusei-hen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lipstick-number-dot-2-joshi-gakusei-hen","created_at":1498815489615,"updated_at":1500266270803,"summary":"A pornographic puzzle game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9]},{"id":41346,"name":"Lipstick #.1: Lolita Hen","slug":"lipstick-number-dot-1-lolita-hen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lipstick-number-dot-1-lolita-hen","created_at":1498815492737,"updated_at":1515831148527,"summary":"A pornographic puzzle game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22425,22490,22482,29730,22422,19785,41895,22481,22423,22406],"tags":[42,268435465,268435487,536870990,536871255,536871759,536871939,536872873,536875281,536875341,536875833,536875895,536876546,536878067,536879188,536880622],"category":0,"keywords":[78,343,847,1027,1961,4369,4429,4921,4983,5634,7155,8276,9710],"themes":[42],"genres":[9,31],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s1pchidwo1nqzcen8wji.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s1pchidwo1nqzcen8wji","width":322,"height":405}},{"id":41347,"name":"Lipstick #.5: Stewardess Hen","slug":"lipstick-number-dot-5-stewardess-hen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lipstick-number-dot-5-stewardess-hen","created_at":1498815494339,"updated_at":1500266253392,"summary":"A pornographic puzzle game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lpsw7xbfvoqipuf6ivch.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lpsw7xbfvoqipuf6ivch","width":1559,"height":966}},{"id":41348,"name":"Kobayashi Hitomi no Hold Up","slug":"kobayashi-hitomi-no-hold-up","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kobayashi-hitomi-no-hold-up","created_at":1498815497210,"updated_at":1500266244427,"summary":"Play a game of Hold Up with the beautiful model Kobayashi Hitomi!","popularity":7.0,"games":[19222,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976,101686],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":652665600000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":652665600000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Sep-07","y":1990,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dxfwvczn3qoaf9j6zgh9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dxfwvczn3qoaf9j6zgh9","width":3660,"height":5230}},{"id":41349,"name":"Hayama Reiko no Date de Blackjack","slug":"hayama-reiko-no-date-de-blackjack","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hayama-reiko-no-date-de-blackjack","created_at":1498815499084,"updated_at":1500266235819,"summary":"Play a round of Blackjack against the beautiful model Reiko Hayama.

Janken Disk Shiro is a block-pushing puzzle game based on the playground game Janken (Rock, Paper, Scissors). \n \nJanken Disk Shiro, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 6 Janken Disk Shiro, is a puzzle game in which the protagonist (who looks uncannily like Disk-kun, the mascot of the Famicom Disk System) must brave a labyrinth of puzzles. In each room there are three variants of hand-shaped blocks between the hero and the exit: each one either making the \"scissors\" gesture, the \"rock\" gesture or the \"paper\" gesture. Pushing a block adjacent to another of a different type causes whichever was the inferior (e.g. with paper and rock, rock is the inferior) to vanish. In addition, each block has a \"strength\" which is signified by its color: green is level 1, yellow is level 2 and red is level 3. If a green block is pushed next to an inferior red block, the red block will instead become yellow instead of vanishing (and then green with a subsequent superior block, and then will vanish after a third). \n \nGameplay revolves around finding the right blocks to push together to clear a way to the exit. Not every block needs to be eliminated: just those that are direct obstacles between the player and the end of the stage. \n \nThe game adopts a familiar veneer of the typical 8-bit fantasy RPG: The player starts in a small town in which they can talk to NPCs and purchase power-ups, they can visit the King in his castle to begin their quest and they can visit the dungeons in which the puzzles are found (after receiving permission from the King). \n \nJanken Disk Shiro has the distinction of being the very last game ever produced for the Famicom Disk System.

Single clock faces depicting one of four angles fall from the top and the player needs to manipulate and place them so they can form larger objects, such as simple formations like squares, diamonds and hourglass shapes to more object-intensive shapes like octagons and hexagons. \n \nThe four angles include 180 degree lines (\"12:30\"), 90 degree lines (\"12:15\"), 135 degree lines (\"~12:22\") and 45 degree lines (\"~12:07\"). Once a clock face is placed, the lines from it extend to connect to any other lines that surround it. Placing lines in such a way that it forms a shape - for example, placing four 90 degree clocks in such a way to form a square - earns the player points and removes the clocks used to form the shape. Larger shapes are more risky but earn more points. \n \nThe player is given some leeway to recover from mistakes: should the player hold the down button to make a clock fall faster, it'll destroy any clocks underneath. A misplacement, therefore, can be rectified with a correctly positioned clock if it falls quickly enough to crush the offending clock. However, the player can only do this a limited number of times per stage.","collection":3320,"popularity":1.0,"games":[60044,29173,25222,55036,18167,23345,55590,19376,8197,73448],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536872407,536873787,536874694,536876128],"category":0,"keywords":[1495,2875,3782,5216],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":672019200000,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":672019200000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Apr-19","y":1991,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":674611200000,"region":8,"human":"1991-May-19","y":1991,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vssqbee5vujvnocxwygw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vssqbee5vujvnocxwygw","width":256,"height":224}},{"id":41370,"name":"All One","slug":"all-one","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/all-one","created_at":1498816097576,"updated_at":1516740787838,"summary":"The third game to be released as a coverdisk for the Japanese Famimaga magazine.
