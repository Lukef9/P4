It is the first in a series of four Nazoler games. \n \nNazoler Land Soukan Gou is the first in a series of minigame collections from SunSoft developed especially for Nintendo's Famicom Disk System peripheral. It was followed by two direct sequels and a quiz-based spin-off. \n \nNazoler Land Soukan Gou (or Nazoler Land Vol. 1) has eight minigames that the player can select from a menu after loading the game up and switching the disk around. These are: \n \nRotation Maze \nA maze-like puzzle game where a small circular being has to pass through a maze filled with dividers. The player can only pass through these dividers if there is room for it to turn around, otherwise it blocks the player's progress. The goal is to find the correct path through the maze. \n \nNazoler Fortune-Telling \nDespite using signs of the Zodiac and suggesting a fortune-telling aspect, the game is actually a variant on the classic strategy board game Mastermind: The goal is to find the right combination of Zodiac symbols, and the game will provide hints by reporting whenever the player includes the right symbol, either in the correct place (represented by a solid star) or the wrong place (represented as a hollowed star). \n \nSuper Jigsaw \nIn this game the player simply has to reconstruct an image after pieces of it have been jumbled up. All the player must do is use two cursors to point to the two pieces they wish to switch around. Restoring the image to its initial state completes the challenge. \n \nSave Princess Momoko! \nPromoted as the \"major feature\", or the most fully-developed of the minigames. The goal is to explore a dungeon in a first-person perspective, similar to classic dungeon crawlers such as Wizardry, Dungeon Master or Shining in the Darkness, while finding items and using the correct items on the right monsters to proceed past them. Encountering these monsters before finding the right item to defeat them causes the player to lose, so there's a degree of trial and error. \n \nJapan's Best Surroundings: Ultra Travel Quiz \nA quiz based on traveling around Japan and general geographical facts. The player selects which type of transportation (train, plane, etc.) they wish to take and answers questions relating to it. \n \nFamicom Reaction Test \nIn this simple \"game\", two players compete to hit the button on their controller as many times as they can in the short time limit. This test is presented like a Wild West duel. \n \nExtrusion Puzzle \nSimilar to Super Jigsaw, only the player is sliding blocks around to make a puzzle appear. Pushing one block that's against another causes all touching blocks to move at once. \n \n3D Maze \nA simple 3D maze, presented in the same first-person perspective as the Saving Princess Momoko game, though with a stark blue and white appearance. The goal is to simply find the way out.","collection":3369,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[70906,28113,27266,25222,25646,28213,236,27725,43800,41400],"tags":[268435465,536871186,536872425,536875240,536875242,536878242,536878243],"category":0,"keywords":[274,1513,4328,4330,7330,7331],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":539568000000,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":539568000000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Feb-06","y":1987,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":541987200000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Mar-06","y":1987,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sbfmcq4n0rie86fd33n4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sbfmcq4n0rie86fd33n4","width":191,"height":209}},{"id":41399,"name":"Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou","slug":"nazoler-land-dai-3-gou","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nazoler-land-dai-3-gou","created_at":1498816408480,"updated_at":1516737688071,"summary":"The third and final core entry in the Nazoler Land series of minigame compilations with a magazine theme.

Two to four human players compete in a board game in which players progress by answering trivia questions. \n \nTomo Bakuso \nThe second minigame starring the schoolgirl Tomo, after Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Blast Tomo. In this game, she is trying to pass through a level of platforms, some of which will block access after being passed through a certain number of times. \n \nTanteidan Boy Nazoler \nAn early example of an \"escape the room\" adventure game, which would become very popular in browser flash games and games like 999. The player must use the items in the room they are trapped in by clicking on items strewn around it and discover the exit. As the player interacts with the room it visibly changes. \n \nBingo \nNot so much a game but a Bingo simulator. Two to four players can generate a unique bingo card and the game will randomly select numbers. The first player to finish their card wins the game. \n \nNazoler BOX \nAs with Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Nazoler BOX, this isn't so much a minigame as a response to letters sent to SunSoft about the Nazoler Land series. Tomo, from Tomo Bakuso, answers user mail. Kirk, the protagonist of SunSoft's Dead Zone, makes a cameo appearance. \n \nNazoler BOX Contest Results \nIn Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou's Nazoler BOX there was a way to create pixel art which users could then print out and enter into a contest.

It contains six minigames, rather than its predecessor's eight. A notable feature of this compilation is that all the minigames are represented as Famicom disks on the select screen, and once a game is chosen an animation shows the disk being loaded in the Famicom Disk System. \n \nThe minigames include: \n \nPatalick \nA panel-switching puzzle game that shares some similarities with Q*Bert (specifically, switching panel colors and the isometric perspective) but is far more cerebral and less active in nature. The goal is to use the shape-shifting protagonist (who transforms from an angel to a devil form) to switch all the panels on the screen to the same color, keeping in mind that every panel in a horizontal and vertical line will flip over. \n \nGeographic Nazoler Quiz \nLike the transportation quiz from the first Nazoler Land, this is a quiz game with a geographical theme. Rather than crossing over Japan in various types of transport, the goal is to travel the world and answer questions on different countries. Answering enough questions correctly allows the player to buy a ticket to the next location and progress forward. \n \nStraw Pistil \nA gambling game in which the player barters against AI opponents for money. The opponents are unpredictable, so the game is largely based on luck. \n \nBlast Tomo \nAs with \"Save Princess Momoko\" from Nazoler Land Soukan Gou (or the Cheetahmen from Action 52), Blast Tomo is the \"major feature\" of the compilation. The goal is to help a schoolgirl, Tomo, reach the bottom of a stage with the strategic placing of a finite number of bombs to destroy blocks in the way. The player must also not any let mice touch Tomo on the way down. \n \nNazoler Boys' Detective Club \nA parody of Famicom Tantei Club, the player is the leader of a detective club currently investigating a mansion supposedly hiding incriminating evidence. Should the player make too many wrong decisions while exploring, the rest of the group will stop listening to them. \n \nNazoler BOX \nNot so much a game as a more overtly magazine section where an animated character (Tomo, from Blast Tomo) reads mail from players of the previous game as well as discuss promotional features of the Nazoler Land series. There's also a section where players can draw their own images, as part of a contest for Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou.","collection":3369,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[70906,43800,41399,19222,27266,41348,10225,28113,49928,66035],"tags":[268435465,536871186,536875240],"category":0,"keywords":[274,4328],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":550454400000,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":550454400000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Jun-12","y":1987,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":553046400000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Jul-12","y":1987,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xsjuagzddyy2i0gepx5l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xsjuagzddyy2i0gepx5l","width":577,"height":640}},{"id":41401,"name":"Nankin no Adventure","slug":"nankin-no-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nankin-no-adventure","created_at":1498816411767,"updated_at":1516754494457,"summary":"A Famicom Disk System adventure game developed by Sunsoft in 1988. \n \nNankin no Adventure is a Famicom Disk System adventure game from SunSoft that plays much like every other Famicom adventure game of the era.

The game occasionally crashes, displaying the debugging screen. To explain this, INTV added the following notice to the instruction book: \n \nBaseball II, however, was a favorite of baseball-fanatic Mike Minkoff (Snafu). The game had been essentially completed, but regularly crashed, despite weeks of debugging at APh. Mattel didn't want to put any more resources into the game, but Mike, although now a Director in charge of Intellivision, Aquarius and M Network development, volunteered to debug the game himself after hours. Since the game had already been announced in several catalogs and press releases (as All-Star Major League Baseball), Mattel kept the title on the schedule and let Mike work on it, on and off as he had time, throughout 1983. \n \nMike managed to clean most of the bugs out of the game, but the cause of one occasional crash eluded him. He linked in a debugging module written by Rick Koenig (Motocross) that displayed the contents of registers and status words on screen when a game halted. Mike was still trying to trace the problem when, in January 1984, Mattel Electronics was closed. \n \nINTV Corporation ultimately released the game; it first appears in their Spring 1986 catalog.

Steve and Joe quickly became a strong design team, taking the concept from a barnyard to a carousel and making the game their own. By the time it was finished, however, Marketing decided that sales of Intellivoice units were too low to support such a \"specialty\" cartridge. Magic Carousel was shelved with the hope that a future increase in Intellivoice sales would justify the game's release. It never happened. \n \nSteve and Joe had proved themselves to be a formidable team, so they were chosen to design the top-secret experimental Intellivision game, Hover Force 3-D. \n \nEASTER EGG: Connect the twinkling stars above the carousel on the title screen to get SEE and JAF, Steve and Joe's initials.","popularity":1.0,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":980985600000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":980985600000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Feb-01","y":2001,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ewen4r6mmbz1uap3pj2t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ewen4r6mmbz1uap3pj2t","width":1520,"height":2056}},{"id":41469,"name":"Melody Blaster","slug":"melody-blaster","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/melody-blaster","created_at":1498817660814,"updated_at":1500269213304,"summary":"In Melody Blaster, individual notes of a specific song fall from the top of the screen and toward a musical staff, and your goal is to play each note on the Music Synthesizer keyboard in the exact moment it passes over its corresponding staff line.

The game includes a spiral-bound manual (the Mattel version, at least) that contains tutorials on each game, with code samples and descriptions of how the game can be modified by the 'player'. Here is a brief rundown of each of the three games. \n \n The Cannon is a rehash of an age-old game - you set the force and angle of a cannon and lob your payload at the enemy. The enemy attempts to do essentially the same thing as you. You can modify various parameters to change the physics of the game world, for example. \n \n In Mr. Basic, your on-screen avatar seems to be compelled to keep a computer server room neat and tidy. You fetch printouts and do other 'menial' tasks. The control is a bit hard, and the game is kind of strange. I seem to remember you fetch flying papers and 'bits' or some such and feed them into the computer in some fashion. Odd, but not really compelling. Again, you can modify the game's variables and such via the Inty Basic language. \n \n The third game is Vampire Bats, in which you defend your building from bats that are eating away the facade. You do this by dropping grenades on them. Hmm. As far as a game goes, it's lame. It may offer you a great way to familiarize yourself w/ Intellivision Basic, but not much else. \n \nInterestingly, it seems that you can plug the cartridge into any old Intellivision without the ECS hooked up and at least play the games. When doing this, you lose the ability to use BASIC - and therefore can't modify the game behavior from the built-in settings.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28558,51281,50307,49557,47200,46745,41475,25268,9551,36297],"tags":[33],"category":0,"themes":[33],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}]},{"id":41471,"name":"Minehunter","slug":"minehunter","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/minehunter","created_at":1498817664662,"updated_at":1500269195996,"summary":"Intellivision Minehunter \tTake command of the advanced mine scanner aboard your helicopter and begin the hunt for all the mines laid down by the enemy.

This began his lifelong fascination with video games and computers. Even though the family had an Atari 2600, Ryan and his brothers were drawn to the Intellivision and its more complex games. \n \nBy 1992, the family Intellivision had long since died, but Ryan started to discover that thrift stores and garage sales were loaded with old video games. For little money, he was able to build what a decade earlier would've been the video game collection of any kid's dreams. Ryan had become an Intellivision fanatic again. \n \nAs we rolled into the new millennium, the feasibility of programming the Intellivision became possible. A handful of individuals managed to create compilers, emulators, documentation, and development hardware of the Intellivision. Ryan's attention was peaked in 2000 when Joe Zbiciak programmed an entirely new game, 4-Tris, and then managed to build and sell it as a complete package. \n \nIn 2002 Ryan found a lot of spare time to start dabbling with Intellivision programming. After experimenting with a variety of \"Hello World\" programs and learning the various features of the Intellivision one by one, Ryan adopted a Minesweeper clone as the theme of his first full game attempt. \n \nRyan chose to do MineHunter for the following reasons: \n \n1) MineHunter is a proven concept. Creating an entirely new game concept is always a risky venture and requires a greater investment of time. (This is why you see so many clones of popular games.) \n \n2) MineHunter is not very difficult to program since it requires little or no animation. (This belief changed when Ryan added the explosion routine.) \n \n3) The game concept had always been a favorite of him. Every time he came across it, he would find himself addicted again. \n \n4) MineHunter is well suited for the Intellivision's display capabilities. MindStrike for the Intellivision ECS proved that it's feasible to make a screen full of numbers look good. \n \n \nThe majority of MineHunter was programmed over the course of about 9 months from mid 2002 to early 2003. The game was about 95% finished when suddenly all of Ryan's free time had disappeared. In addition, his interest in programming the Intellivision was starting to wane due to realization that it may be impossible to ever build and sell games. Some brief research showed Ryan that building actual cartridges and producing the associated manuals, boxes, and overlays would be insanely expensive and require an immense amount of time. \n \nRyan's Intellivision programming work was falling farther and farther to the backburner when in late 2003 he was approached by the Chris Neiman and David Harley about the possibility of making MineHunter into an actual cartridge. Over 2003 and 2004 they put a lot of effort, research and investment into working out a plan that would allow for the production of new games to be published just like the originals were 20 years ago. Their efforts encouraged him to complete the programming of MineHunter in 2004.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1044057600000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":1044057600000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Feb-01","y":2003,"m":2}]},{"id":41472,"name":"Number Jumble","slug":"number-jumble","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/number-jumble","created_at":1498817667534,"updated_at":1500285512883,"summary":"[Unreleased 1984 ECS] Cut across fire in a Time Sailer, cruise under water in a Submarine, fly through thin air in a Zeppelin, or roll across the Earth in a Tank -- but never stop firing at the dreadful creatures that beset you!

Each player controls an array of forces with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's \"flag.\" \n \nThe game can be played on any of thousands of different countryside maps -- the first thousand of which are selectable at the beginning of the game. All of these maps show roads, towns, hills, lakes, forests, orchards, and fields, and these geographic features impose restrictions and necessitate clever planning on the part of the player. \n \nAt the beginning of the game each player has control of the following military resources: \n \n 12 infantry \n 3 armored personnel carriers \n 2 tanks \n 1 artillery piece \n 2 bazookas \n 2 mortars \n 1 flag \n \nYou can capture opposing forces which subsequently become yours. \n \nIn order to wage an effective war, you must allocate your resources into patrols, direct the patrols across the map, encounter enemy patrols, fight battles, besiege towns, and eventually capture or destroy the enemy flag. \n \nPRODUCTION HISTORY \nThis wargame simulation took a long time in programming (officially 391 days, compared to 170 days for Night Stalker, begun at about the same time); when completed in mid-1982, Marketing was concerned that its design already looked dated. \n \nA second concern was that, due to the complexity of the game, it required more memory than an Intellivision contained; the cartridge would have to include 256 bytes of RAM onboard. Only USCF Chess had been approved for onboard RAM, an expensive proposition. \n \nWhen the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) was given the green light, Gabriel Baum, VP of Applications Software, proposed changing Land Battle to an ECS title; the ECS had an additional 2K of RAM available for cartridges. Marketing resisted this -- they still wanted Land Battle as a stand-alone game. Peggi Decarli was assigned to give the game a graphics makeover. \n \nAfter the makeover, Marketing still didn't find it visually interesting enough. By that time, wargame fanatic Steve Sents, having completed Deadly Discs, had started work on an ECS wargame called Desert Fox, which Marketing liked the looks of better. The decision was made to kill Land Battle and incorporate as much of its gameplay and programming as possible into the Desert Fox design.","popularity":1.0,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":917740800000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":917740800000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Jan-31","y":1999,"m":1}]},{"id":41474,"name":"King of the Mountain","slug":"king-of-the-mountain","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/king-of-the-mountain","created_at":1498818368642,"updated_at":1500269161525,"summary":"[Unfinished 1983] Head up the mountain, avoiding bears, boulders and inclement weather.

The player pilots a lone space tank on orbits of planets while attempting to defend planets from ever increasing waves of alien spaceships. The plot takes the player through a series of missions as a member of the Planetary Guard, a galactic militia formed of conscripts and volunteers with outdated equipment, who are left on their own to defend strategically less important backwater planets in the war against alien bugs. \n \nObjectives of missions vary from destroying all enemies to defending targets on ground or on orbit such as other space ships. Each mission features dozens of enemies with different behaviors, for example, some attempt to destroy targets on planets and some attack the player immediately where as others go for players defense structures immediately. Destroying enemies leaves debris on the battlefield and bonus pick-ups, which give either health, score bonuses, multipliers, special weapons or boosts to existing weapons. \n \nBetween missions player visits the hangar in which he can buy or upgrade his tanks main weapon, hull or shield systems. There he can also buy defences, such as mines and turrets, which are dragged to the battlefield during missions. Items are bought and upgraded with Bucks and IGC, which are gained from missions. Bucks are collected from fallen enemies and IGC is translated from score gained in missions. \n \nMissions have side objectives, of which completion is awarded with medals. Side objectives are usually something difficult to achieve such as pass the mission under X seconds or gain X amount of score in the mission. These medals are required to open new missions and as such to advance in the game.","popularity":1.0,"games":[76246,19341,28029,32902,24920,272,68287,10039,68142,36608],"tags":[1,268435461],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1402704000000,"platforms":[39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1402704000000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jun-14","y":2014,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zbgozxqozjjqvw2zbpkb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zbgozxqozjjqvw2zbpkb","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jqwiddhsdllwybu0dcdd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jqwiddhsdllwybu0dcdd","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ll8e0o9nbwjauernluau.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ll8e0o9nbwjauernluau","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/erzjkmy5u9npf7beb4co.jpg","cloudinary_id":"erzjkmy5u9npf7beb4co","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yrg3ptdgh1ks4yu4agdf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yrg3ptdgh1ks4yu4agdf","width":1024,"height":768}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vpqkwbl1eig4h3eie167.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vpqkwbl1eig4h3eie167","width":2048,"height":1136}},{"id":41488,"name":"CanYouTilt","slug":"canyoutilt","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/canyoutilt","created_at":1498818430921,"updated_at":1500269734164,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1391990400000,"platforms":[39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1391990400000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Feb-10","y":2014,"m":2}]},{"id":41489,"name":"Kingdoms Fall","slug":"kingdoms-fall","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kingdoms-fall","created_at":1498818432436,"updated_at":1500269683306,"summary":"Kingdoms Fall is an epic top-down action adventure game for iOS.

Pressing the number first will affect the vertical bars. \n \nThe player controlling the keyboard masterminds the strategy it takes to beat the Great Monkey at his own game. \n \n\"Ladders\" can be built to help the men get quickly to any part of the screen. Ladders can also be \"unbuilt\" to prevent the monkeys from using them. \n \n\"Cages\" can be built to temporarily delay tagged monkeys from tagging the men. \n \nHint: Pretend that the cage has a door and memorize its coordinates. One of the men tags a monkey and uses the joystick to release him into the cage. The player using the keyboard has already preset the \"door\" coordinates and is ready to press ENTER. The completely closed cage will delay a tagged red monkey from tagging one of the men. \n \nThe player controlling the keyboard can also insert obstacle bars in the path of pursuing red monkeys. \n \n \nBANANAS! \n(For professionals only. 3 players.) \n \nPress RESET. \n \nPress 0 on the numeric section of the keyboard. \n \nInsert the keyboard entries for Tailspin, Shuteye and Monkey Chess is various combinations.

Floating amongst the clouds, cruising far above sea level, this is a place unlike any you've ever seen. Please enjoy your voyage... \n \nThe third game in the popular Bioshock series, BioShock Infinite breaks away from the underwater setting of the first two games to take players into a floating city held aloft by dirigibles. The game is set in 1912. You play as Booker DeWitt, a disgraced former private detective who's picked up a new case. Your goal is to find Elizabeth, a young woman who's gone missing and return her unharmed. The only problem is that she's being kept on this flying city. Columbia was once a symbol of America's success as a nation, floating around the world as a traveling World's Fair, a marvel of human innovation.

Though Booker rescues Elizabeth, the two become involved with the city's warring factions: the nativist and elite Founders that rule Columbia and strive to keep its privileges for White Americans, and the Vox Populi, underground rebels representing the underclass of the city. During this conflict, Booker learns that Elizabeth possesses strange powers to manipulate \"Tears\" in the space-time continuum that ravage Columbia, and soon discovers her to be central to the city's dark secrets. \n \nThe player controls Booker Dewitt throughout the game, eventually working with the AI-controlled Elizabeth. Like previous BioShock games, the player uses a combination of weapons, clothing called Gear that offer unique attributes, and psychokinetic powers granted through Vigors. Elizabeth's powers can also be used to help fight hostile forces. In contrast to the limited spaces of the underwater city of Rapture, the openness of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat, including combat that takes place aboard the city's Sky-Line rollercoaster-like rail system. Downloadable content for the game includes a story-based mission, Burial at Sea, that links Infinite's story to that of the original BioShock game. \n \nThe game won over 85 pre-release awards for its display at E3 2011, including Best of Show from the Game Critics Awards. At release, BioShock Infinite received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its story, setting, and visual art design, and is often regarded as one of the best video games of the seventh generation of consoles. According to review aggregator Metacritic, it was the third-highest rated video game of 2013. Within two months of release, it sold over 3.7 million retail copies, and has since sold more than 11 million copies overall.

If his mission fails, there will be no Operation Overlord, no D-Day landings, and no Victory in Europe.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kywrt9ssjodl6jsgg4zu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kywrt9ssjodl6jsgg4zu","width":1500,"height":844}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/njqvdx5xizkm9z0idtja.jpg","cloudinary_id":"njqvdx5xizkm9z0idtja","width":1006,"height":1294}},{"id":41644,"name":"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - Steelbook Edition","slug":"deus-ex-mankind-divided-steelbook-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided-steelbook-edition","created_at":1498828266251,"updated_at":1515707355992,"summary":"Only at GAME Steelbook edition includes: \n- Exclusive Steelbook featuring Adam Jensen \n- Day One Edition game \n \nSecure the Day One Edition of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided to obtain all of the following items: \n- Covert Agent pack \n- Digital OST Sampler \n- Extra in-game mission \n- Digital books","popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":9498,"version_title":"Steelbook Edition","games":[59516,55289,25311,36608,37088,47823,16468,26192,1221,6036],"tags":[1,23,268435461,268435468,268435470,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1,23],"genres":[5,12,14,31]},{"id":41645,"name":"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - Collectors Edition","slug":"deus-ex-mankind-divided-collectors-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided-collectors-edition","created_at":1498828268377,"updated_at":1515707347455,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":9498,"version_title":"Collectors Edition","games":[59516,55289,25311,36608,37088,47823,16468,26192,1221,6036],"tags":[1,23,268435461,268435468,268435470,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1,23],"genres":[5,12,14,31],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/za2gftpcluez31v1rsx3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"za2gftpcluez31v1rsx3","width":1500,"height":844}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jsncfzrw7ue6hcgfvm77.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jsncfzrw7ue6hcgfvm77","width":1258,"height":1500}},{"id":41646,"name":"A Life M36 Planet","slug":"a-life-m36-planet","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/a-life-m36-planet","created_at":1498828416939,"updated_at":1500301225627,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":539136000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}]},{"id":41647,"name":"Addicta Ball","slug":"addicta-ball","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/addicta-ball","created_at":1498828417112,"updated_at":1515773234124,"summary":"Addicta Ball is a Breakout clone with a twist.

At that time, the evil Emperor Penguin happened to meet one of his subjects, Lucytesse, of matchless beauty, and he fell madly in love with her. \n \nHis love was unrequited, though. She only had eyes for her beloved Pentaro, a young good-looking penguin from the neighborhood. They were a happy couple but the Emperor, in a fit of rage and jealousy, kidnapped Lucytesse, and carried her off to his palace at the South Pole. \n \nPentaro departed swiftly to rescue her and, after countless perils and adventures in the ice and crevices of the South Pole, finally succeeded in reaching the Emperor's palace and rescuing his sweetheart. \n \nThey lived happily together for a while, far from the realms of the Emperor. But he had not had his final say. His revenge would consist of keeping the merry couple apart, kidnapping Pentaro this time and secluding him in a far-off place of his kingdom, far from the South Pole, lost in the boundaries of his realms and utterly unknown to our penguin. He was hoping that Pentaro's own desperation, far from his beloved and unable to escape, would become a punishment worse than death. \n \nHis cruelty knew no bounds. But Pentaro refused to resign himself to the fate the Emperor had planned for him.

Hong Kong was most affected by the mysterious demonic attack. Terrible diseases turned the once prosperous city into a pale shadow of itself. But once people came back to see what happened to the isolated city, they saw it was ruled by a new order - a corporation called SIVA. The new order proclaimed New Hong Kong to be an independent state. People's Republic of China and United Kingdom signed an agreement in which they both renounced their claims over the city. \n \nThe player takes on the role of Tianren, a \"diver\" (demon-hunter) who lives in Hong Kong. His place of birth and the identity of his parents are unknown. Together with a girl named Meihong, he was brought up in the house of a wise Master. Traveling through the huge city, gathering information and fighting demonic forces, Tianren will have to unravel the mystery surrounding the corporation SIVA and the supernatural beings from Chinese myths. \n \nIllusion City is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. Unlike most games of the genre, it has no overworld, and takes place entirely in a vast city divided into several districts. The player advances the story by exploring the city, talking to non-playable characters, gathering information, receiving missions, and eventually heading into large, complex hostile areas. There are no random battles in the game; all enemies are visibly moving on the field, and many of them can be avoided. \n \nCombat is turn-based, utilizing an \"over-the-shoulder\" perspective similar to that of Phantasy Star II. Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked. In addition, certain characters can use offensive, supportive, and healing techniques. \n \nThe game's visual style aims for realistic presentation of locations and characters, and shares more common traits with contemporary Western visual aesthetics than the traditional Japanese anime art.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,25300,19448,11567,36950,54842,27314,25311,26145,27920],"tags":[18,268435468,268435487,536870981,536870990,536871015,536871327,536871882,536871938,536871939,536872954,536875258,536875372,536875406,536875437,536875472],"category":0,"keywords":[69,78,103,415,970,1026,1027,2042,4346,4460,4494,4525,4560],"themes":[18],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k6cldpk00xz3vl1aryeb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k6cldpk00xz3vl1aryeb","width":640,"height":866}},{"id":41711,"name":"F1 Douchuuki","slug":"f1-douchuuki","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/f1-douchuuki","created_at":1498829370210,"updated_at":1500302049482,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}]},{"id":41712,"name":"Parodius: The Octopus Saves the Earth","slug":"parodius-the-octopus-saves-the-earth","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/parodius-the-octopus-saves-the-earth","created_at":1498829374024,"updated_at":1500302040390,"summary":"The first title in the Parodius series, although it is often confused with its sequel Parodius!

Many of the characters and enemies are derived from that famous shooter series, while other elements are extracted from other Konami titles, such as Antarctic Adventure and TwinBee. This game is of particular note in the series as being heavily infused with Japanese culture and folklore. \nThe gameplay is very similar to the Gradius games, with other aspects from games such as TwinBee. However, the characters are replaced with silly characters taken from either these or other Konami games as well as Japanese culture. The music is mostly taken from classical music pieces. \n \nThe player can play as either Takosuke, an octopus, the Penguin (father of Pentarou) from Antarctic Adventure and the exclusive MSX game Penguin Adventure, Goemon from the Ganbare Goemon series, the Popolon knight from the MSX game Knightmare or the Vic Viper spaceship from Gradius. The game is composed of six stages consisting of various obstacles and enemies such as penguins and bees, as well as more traditional Gradius enemies such as moai.

The heroes are, in order: \n \nRay Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power; Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping; Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly. \n \nIt is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.","collection":4884,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[12632,27209,55092,36926,26769,47823,26841,17583,37088,36950],"tags":[1,17,22,268435461,268435489,536871063,536871078,536871208,536871938,536875046,536875308,536875434,536875879,536876348,536877036,536879806,1073741827],"developers":[250],"publishers":[250],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[151,166,296,1026,4134,4396,4522,4967,5436,6124,8894],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":507600000000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[125,77,37,5,18,27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1391558400000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Feb-05","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1196121600000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Nov-27","y":2007,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1206316800000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Mar-24","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":2,"platform":77,"date":567907200000,"region":5,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":125,"date":549504000000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Jun-01","y":1987,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":527385600000,"region":5,"human":"1986-Sep-18","y":1986,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":507600000000,"region":5,"human":"1986-Feb-01","y":1986,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xshzypcd6icurw1ncvta.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xshzypcd6icurw1ncvta","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pssqesaj69jemho2vvu9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pssqesaj69jemho2vvu9","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jsbu2uvyzljylrqpvczf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jsbu2uvyzljylrqpvczf","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fq3tovjn8116ejjra0rd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fq3tovjn8116ejjra0rd","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sm6ua8donjnkni8grskn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sm6ua8donjnkni8grskn","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rusrjtexlpoajroedyrl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rusrjtexlpoajroedyrl","width":256,"height":240}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ykahx7jgitsrrqs7okqy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ykahx7jgitsrrqs7okqy","width":1000,"height":1414},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":41724,"name":"Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness","slug":"hydlide-ii-shine-of-darkness","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hydlide-ii-shine-of-darkness","created_at":1498829851645,"updated_at":1513086813600,"summary":"Hydlide II: Shine Of Darkness is an action RPG, and the second installment in the Hydlide series. \n \nIn a different space a wonderful world existed, called Fairy Land, which was dominated by swords and magic after the times of domination by monsters and evil had ended.

At a young age, he lost an arm and eye, and was soon ridiculed by his peers for it. Eventually, it proved to be too much, and Gaou became a thief. In spite of his corrupt lifestyle, however, he was able to settle down with a wife - for a while, at least. It all came crashing to a halt over one little disagreement, as Gaou cussed her out... and then killed her! \n \nFilled with remorse, Gaou chose to repent his wicked deeds, and turned to a Buddhist monk for help. The monk's teachings eventually led him to pursue his passion for sculpting, which led to a series of powerful works renowned for the raw emotions pent up inside him that were expressed therein. But it wasn't enough - Gaou needed to be completely reborn! Hearing about the mystical phoenix, who grants those who drink its blood eternal life, from a fellow sculptor named Akanemaru, Gaou set out on a journey to find the great bird of fire... and hopefully to be reincarnated... \n \nBased on the \"Hō-ō\" (or \"Karma\" volume) of Osamu Tezuka's famous manga Hinotori (or \"Phoenix\"), \"Hinotori\" is a vertically-scrolling shooting game where Gaou's goal is to locate the mystical phoenix across 6 stages of labyrinths, enemies and various other obstacles. As the game progresses, Gaou can power up by obtaining phoenix plumes to activate special weapons and other items to help him gain abilities such as invulnerability and special shots. In order to reach the final boss and pay a visit to the phoenix, Gaou must obtain a series of keys scattered across the stages - and must even backtrack to find others.

Taking place on a series of massively sprawling maps, as opposed to shrunken JRPG-style maps which warp you to new maps when entering buildings, all enemies can be seen immediately. Furthermore you never fight more than a single enemy at a time.

Passages: During the first phase of each level, the player must maneuver their ship through the narrow, moving passages with the joystick while shooting six of the warlord's defense forces with button 4. If any of the six are missed, they will go off-screen and be recycled to give the player another chance, but more fuel will be used. In addition to various defense forces which must be destroyed, there are extra targets that can be shot for additional points. Unlike the regular defense forces, the extra targets are non-threatening in that they will not shoot or crash into the player's ship. During this phase, space debris will also be shooting up through the play field. Space debris cannot be shot and can only be avoided by dodging it by moving from side to side. The walls of the narrow passage are also a danger to the player. If the player's ship crashes into a wall, a life will be lost. There are gaps between the moving walls which the player can maneuver quickly into and out of so as to avoid approaching enemies or space debris, however as game play becomes faster this will present a higher risk to crashing into oncoming walls. \n \n2. Walls: If the passages are successfully navigated and the the required six defense forces are destroyed, the player will enter the second phase. This is a series of walls with holes. In the first level of the game, there are five successive walls, each with one hole through which the player must maneuver their ship. In the second level of play, there will be six successive walls, in the third level, seven walls, etc. Also the size of the holes will become smaller in each new level. The hole will be in a different location on each wall. After passing through the hole in each wall (but prior to entering the hole in the next wall) there will be a fuel cell which must be passed to pick up. If the fuel cells are missed, the game will continue, but the fuel gauge will be continuously depleting. Note: in early levels of the game, all of the fuel cells will not need to be captured. However as the game progresses and fuel is consumed faster, all of the fuel cells will need to be captured in order to make it through the next level. \n \nAfter successfully completing three levels of play, the player will come face-to-face with the warlord's escape ship in open space. The warlord's ship must be shot five times to be destroyed during the first encounter, seven times on the next encounter, nine times the next, etc. The warlord's ship will shoot torpedoes at the player's ship, which can be either avoided or shot at to be destroyed.

The Light and Dark forces are engaged in a fierce war and Böser, leader of the Dark Army, is now ready to capture the Rall Tower, source of the world's energy. Sieghart, leader of the Light army, is the only one who stands between the evil Böser and the complete decimation of the kingdom. Gaia no Monshō is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":593568000000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":593568000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Oct-23","y":1988,"m":10}]},{"id":42064,"name":"Paranoia","slug":"paranoia","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/paranoia","created_at":1499067752528,"updated_at":1515578709590,"summary":"Fight to survive others and yourself in this text adventure for iOS.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36950,13189,27314,25222,41895,22425,55803,25211,26766,25300],"tags":[268435461,268435487,536871938,536871939,536872131,536873308,536875172],"category":0,"keywords":[1026,1027,1219,2396,4260],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":638928000000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":638928000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Apr-01","y":1990,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lyzzfj0lrat8jfr5ehsx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lyzzfj0lrat8jfr5ehsx","width":184,"height":172}},{"id":42065,"name":"Madou Ou Granzort","slug":"madou-ou-granzort","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/madou-ou-granzort","created_at":1499067753569,"updated_at":1515802944454,"summary":"In 2050, after a great earthquake, the Moon got an atmosphere and conditions for normal human life. 50 years later, the Moon is inhabited by humans and a great tourist attraction.

And things are just not as easy as it may sound - Hanii has to jump over various enemies and try not to fall into deep holes dug into the ground, without forgetting the occasional change in scrolling direction and the myriad of other exciting, and often lethal, effects. A time limit also urges him to hurry and to quickly reach the end of each stage. Every little helps, and tiny wood signs scattered around every road tell Hany how far the next exit is. Additionally, special items can be collected along the way, such as Blue jars giving Hanii extra lives (twenty five of them need to be collected though), Mystery Jars giving from 100 to 1000 points, Extra Lives, Time Clocks, Rockets, Trampolines and other unique and often bizarre super powers (he can turn into a race-car or an almighty warrior in some stages!).

Further, the trademark P-38 has been replaced with a Boeing Stearman E75 N68828. \n \nIn 1991, this version was converted to the PC Engine as simply 1943 Kai, again Japan-only; this version itself contains many additional levels and original music. \n \nThe game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese air fleet that bombed the American aircraft carrier, pursue all Japanese air and sea forces, fly through the 16 stages of play, and make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 of these stages consist of an air-to-sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as the stage boss), while 5 stages consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese bombers with a mother bomber at the end. \n \nAs in 1942, players pilot a P-38 Lightning. Controls are also similar: button 1 fires main weapons, and button two performs two special actions: a loop maneuver like in 1942, or one of three special attacks in exchange for some of the player's fuel. Indeed, players now have only one life, in the form of a large \"fuel\" meter; constantly depleting, but refillable by collecting various powerups (chiefly \"Pow\" icons). In 2-player mode, when both players overlap their planes on screen, the energy bar can be transferred from the player with more fuel to the player with less. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a new main weapon. \n \nThere are cheat codes, different for every stage, ranging from holding down a fire button or pointing the joystick in certain direction, player(s) are rewarded with fully upgraded weapons.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,68287,36950,46611,27314,64204,28029,11253,25300,10209],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871882,536872617,536873064,536874398,536874743,536874745,536875075,536875151,536875822,536876008,536876016,536876120,536876506,536876634,536876872],"category":0,"keywords":[166,970,1705,2152,3486,3831,3833,4163,4239,4910,5096,5104,5208,5594,5722,5960],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":539136000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i5snzbnk3t3aqdvjfz9c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i5snzbnk3t3aqdvjfz9c","width":256,"height":192}},{"id":42080,"name":"Valkyrie no Densetsu","slug":"valkyrie-no-densetsu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/valkyrie-no-densetsu","created_at":1499068174028,"updated_at":1511564439294,"summary":"Valkyrie no Densetsu (translated as: \"Legend of Valkyrie\") is a platform/shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan.

You take control of a robot who must collect Earth's Energy Crystals that were stolen by \"Computer Controlled Androids\". The uniqueness of the game comes from the fact that not only can you walk up and down the corridors on the bottom of the screen, but also on the sides and top of the screen. Therefore, the game has a 3D aspect to it which makes your mission much harder to complete, especially considering that the controls change accordingly with the different sides of the screen (if you are controlling your robot on the bottom part of the screen all that is needed to move forward is a press \"up\" on the joystick. However, once on the top of the screen, a press \"down\" on the joystick moves you forward). This change of joystick movement helps create a more realistic feel that really helps the game out and makes it more fun to play, however frustrating it may be first. After you have the controls for the game down, which can prove to be very tricky, the next step is to go about completing your mission to get back all the of the Earth's Energy Crystals, which are represented by little red diamonds throughout the 3D maze. However, there are a few curve balls thrown in. If you are unable to collect the crystals after 40 seconds, they become radioactive. This means that if you touch a crystal once it's radioactive (they turn white after becoming so) you will lose a life and fall off into space towards a purple alien ship which appears in the center of the screen. On the other hand, if you do collect all 4 crystals from that round, you might think your job is done, but that's not the case. Even after all the crystals are collected you must still blast the white androids which follow you throughout the maze. Only after all of the androids have been killed will you be able to advance forward. \n \nThe robot you control in the game is also equipped with an electronic vapor gun that will shoot a pulsar beam all the way around the screen which can actually come back and hit you if not careful (and the range of your shot increases as the game progresses, so an accurate hit is necessary later on!). When you do manage to hit one of the androids through they do not simply vanish from the screen, but instead leave behind an energy mass which cannot be passed through by your robot. On later levels when there are many androids roaming about the screen a well planned shot is necessary, because you could actually cage yourself in due to the energy masses. However, there is a way out of a jam if you find that all the crystals have turned radioactive (and therefore cannot be collected) or if you find yourself caged in by energy masses. By the press of a button, you can Beam Up to your yellow ship and then be presented with a fresh board and start all over (but then you lose any crystals you might have managed to collect and the game gets a little harder). One other thing to note about the androids is the fact that they can shoot anti-gravity spray at you, so getting out of the way of their line of fire is another challenge faced on your quest to save the earth. One last little nifty feature of the game is the ability to wear a defensive shield which makes you invincible to anything on the screen. However, the shield can only be used for as long as the red bar on the top of the screen indicates (you actually can take off the shield at any point after putting it on to save the energy bar from being depleted). The shield, and all these other little bonuses tossed into the game, can all be accessed by either the press of the button or by voice recognition if the MBX gaming add-on is attached. All one would need to do in order to activate the shield, for example, would be to simply say \"Shield\" into the microphone! \n \nSpace Bandits is a very interesting game, and has a lot of unique features. However, the mainstream gamer might be turned off a little by the easiness of the first few rounds. At first I wrote this game off as being too easy, but after playing it through to the 5th level I found myself being caged in numerous times by the androids who were out to get the crystals I had collected! So when you give this game a try, play into it a little as the challenge can pick up fairly quickly. In addition, as with all MBX cartridges, this game uses voice recognition and synthesis very well. Being able to speak plain English into a microphone to tell your robot what to do is really a great added dimension to the game. So if you're a space shoot 'em up junkie, you might find all the options available in Space Bandits interesting and entertaining.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76246,19341,28029,32902,24920,272,68287,10039,68142,36608],"tags":[1,268435461],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[129],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":129,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}]},{"id":42177,"name":"Sneggit","slug":"sneggit","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sneggit","created_at":1499069898314,"updated_at":1500612397806,"summary":"In Sneggit, you control a chicken trying to gather up eggs from the barnyard before the snakes get them!

Continuing their policy of providing educational material that is both instructional and entertaining, the staffs of Scott, Foresman and Company and the Texas Instruments Learning Center expand their mathematics series to include the Multiplication 1 Solid State Software™ Command Module. The Multiplication 1 module shows your child the \"Magic of Multiplication\". It provides a strong foundation not only in the basic facts, but also in later work with larger numbers. Colorful graphics and lively music transform the learning of factors and products into an exciting experience — almost like magic! The Multiplication 1 module contains eight activities: \n- EQUAL GROUPS changes an addition problem into a multiplication problem using the concept of number grouping. \n- FACTORS 2 TO 5 explains horizontal multiplication problems for factors 2 through 5. \n- FACTORS 0 TO 5 demonstrates multiplication of a factor by 2, 1, and then 0 (zero). \n- FACTORS 6 TO 9 increases the multiplication skills to include the factors 6 to 9. \n- MULTIPLY ANOTHER WAY presents a smooth transition from the horizontal multiplication problem to the vertical problem. \n- HOW MANY IN ALL uses a random number of hats \"sprouting\" a random number of flowers to demonstrate solving for the product. \n- COMPLETE THE BOX provides one factor while your child selects the other and then solves for the missing number (the product of the two factors). \n- REVIEW THE FACTS offers 28 multiplication problems with factors 0 (zero) to 9. A stage is set complete with a magician and audience that stands up each time your child correctly answers the displayed problem. \n \nThe Multiplication 1 module advances your child to more difficult drills according to the number of correct responses given in each activity. The computer automatically advances to the next activity if your child answers 80 percent of the drill problems correctly. If less than 60 percent of the problems are answered correctly, the computer returns to the appropriate activity, providing your child with more practice. This automation helps alleviate anxieties caused by consistently incorrect responses, making the learning of mathematical skills a pleasurable and rewarding experience. With this module, Texas Instruments continues its tradition of applying innovative Solid State Speech™ technology to educational activities. Multiplication 1 is designed to work with or without the Texas Instruments Solid State Speech™ Synthesizer (sold separately). However, the Speech Synthesizer must be attached to activate the voice of the computer. The computer's voice then gives directions, reads the equations, and encourages your child to \"Try again\" when he or she gives an incorrect answer. The addition of speech strengthens the learning process since your child can hear, as well as see, the correct answers.","popularity":1.0,"category":0},{"id":42185,"name":"Burger Builder","slug":"burger-builder","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/burger-builder","created_at":1499069925033,"updated_at":1513014647628,"summary":"Burger Builder is an action platform game similar to BurgerTime.

Beating the game leads to the ending and a password (A, B, L, R, X, Y, Start) that allows players to select the same character as their opponent in versus mode.","collection":3759,"popularity":1.0,"games":[56987,70861,23113,14763,19658,76428,2558,62743,1235,41828],"tags":[268435460,536870926,536870990,536871019,536873299],"category":0,"keywords":[14,78,107,2387],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":728265600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":728265600000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Jan-29","y":1993,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":730944000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Mar-01","y":1993,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xl2is3zowroxbabf9zsi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xl2is3zowroxbabf9zsi","width":190,"height":342}},{"id":42272,"name":"SD Ultra Battle: Ultraman Densetsu","slug":"sd-ultra-battle-ultraman-densetsu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sd-ultra-battle-ultraman-densetsu","created_at":1499071161192,"updated_at":1516596388129,"summary":"SD Ultra Battle: Ultraman Densetsu is an Action game, developed by Tom Create and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1996.","collection":3046,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,25300,71455,42273,2558,36950,27314,142,64204,14763],"tags":[1,18,268435460,536870926,536871019,536871882,536873299,536875054,536875289,536875290,536875291],"category":0,"keywords":[14,107,970,2387,4142,4377,4378,4379],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":835920000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":835920000000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Jun-28","y":1996,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":838512000000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Jul-28","y":1996,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gnwm8epq8ovoenxisfvl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gnwm8epq8ovoenxisfvl","width":640,"height":1364}},{"id":42273,"name":"SD Ultra Battle: Seven Densetsu","slug":"sd-ultra-battle-seven-densetsu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sd-ultra-battle-seven-densetsu","created_at":1499071162633,"updated_at":1516596397420,"summary":"SD Ultra Battle: Seven Densetsu is an Action game, developed by Tom Create and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1996.","collection":3046,"popularity":1.0,"games":[68287,25300,71455,42272,2558,36950,27314,142,64204,14763],"tags":[1,18,268435460,536870926,536871019,536871882,536873299,536875054,536875289,536875290,536875291],"category":0,"keywords":[14,107,970,2387,4142,4377,4378,4379],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":835920000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":835920000000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Jun-28","y":1996,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":838512000000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Jul-28","y":1996,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ed0huklstm3gwgqm1ckn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ed0huklstm3gwgqm1ckn","width":640,"height":1335}},{"id":42274,"name":"Go!

The game came in four weekly broadcasts and made new additions to the original, such as weather, many new dungeons, and a new story. \nThe game was much like a Second Quest or Master Quest of A Link to the Past, sharing a very similar overworld with slight changes and entirely new dungeons. Unlike a Second Quest however, it has an entirely new story. Various actions earned the player points, and these points could later be traded in to Nintendo for different prizes. \n \nAncient Stone Tablets is different from most other Zelda games as the game's central heroes are actually the avatars of the player's ID for the BS-X Broadcasting System (Super Famicon), drawn into Hyrule, which is also true for BS The Legend of Zelda. The difference being that this time the player does not take the place of Link, but takes part in a new tale set after the events of A Link to the Past. The male character wears a green tunic (though others are later available) and a backwards baseball cap. The female character has long red hair and is otherwise almost exactly the same as the male.","storyline":"The Hero of Light - Week 1 \nThe events of Ancient Stone Tablets occur a mere six years after the destruction of Ganon by the hero, Link in A Link to the Past.[6] Hyrule is enjoying a time of peace and tranquility, but Princess Zelda suffers from a dark, recurring dream showing a shadow over a temple; a premonition of evil to come. One day, she witnesses a mysterious and brilliant light in the sky to the east. Aginah, the younger brother of the wise man Sahasrahla and now living in his old hideout near the Eastern Palace also witnesses such a light, and travels to investigate. There he finds a strange youth lying on the ground. Zelda, also following the light, meets up with Aginah, and they both carry the child to rest in Sahasrahla's hideout. Confused by the youth's unusual clothes, they believe the child not to hail from Kakariko Village. Speaking to Aginah while the youngster sleeps, Zelda learns that his brother Sahasrahla had also sensed danger surrounding Hyrule and had left the land to find the hero, Link. While Link has not yet returned, Zelda senses that if this new youth was endowed with courage, he or she may be the Hero of Light. \n \nThe Monsters Return - Week 2 \nSome time after Zelda sets off to return to Hyrule Castle, a Soldier who guards the Eastern Palace appears before Aginah, claiming that a horde of monsters had appeared, killing the other guards protecting the temple. As the sole survivor, he passes this information on to Aginah despite his injuries. Aginah remains with the youth, hoping Zelda's belief in him or her is true. When the child awakens, Aginah informs the youngster of the monsters that are attacking their land, and explains that it is dangerous to go alone without a weapon. He states that a Sword and Shield can be found in the Eastern Palace, but he himself is too old to go there. He lends the youth an Ocarina and a Bug-Catching Net belonging to Saharshala, and also a Bottle containing a magical Golden Bee. He informs the child that the bee will attack monsters, but flee from anyone who holds a blade, and that the ocarina can be used to return to the entrance of a dungeon. With that, the new hero embarks on his or her journey. \n \nThe Tablets - Week 3 \nAfter obtaining weaponry and exploring the Eastern Palace and a dark dungeon hidden behind the Waterfall of Wishing, the hero obtains two mysterious tablets from the Dungeon Masters, the Armos Knights and Moldorm. The hero also rescues Zelda from a monster attack and escorts her to Hyrule Castle. After the hero's quests in the dungeons are completed, he or she and Aginah meet up with Zelda in the castle and proceed to study the unusual tablets. Aginah concludes that they should travel to his elder brother's house in Kakariko Village to search for clues to deciphering the markings. Unfortunately, Aginah fails to discover anything important about them, so implores the hero to travel forth and collect more of them from the dungeon monsters. After obtaining two more tablets, Zelda suggests they travel instead to Link's House to obtain the Book of Mudora, which may be able to translate the text. While Aginah searches the house, Zelda calls for the Fortune Teller to divine the location of the book, while the hero continues to search for the tablets. Aginah does eventually locate the book, upon which point he and the hero meet with Zelda at the castle. \n \nThe Silver Arrows and the Demon King - Week 4 \nThe translated text of the tablets, written in the language of ancient Hyrule states that a sealed power, the Silver Arrows, is buried on the mountain. Aginah and the hero travel to the Sanctuary at the foot of the mountain, but Zelda follows, claiming she had another prophetic dream, this time of her holding the Book of Mudora on top of Death Mountain. Zelda insists on traveling with the hero to the summit of the mountain, as she is the only one who can read the Book of Mudora. During their quest to obtain the final two tablets and reach the summit, the Fortune Teller sees the King of Evil in a vision. Ganon's malice had kept his spirit alive despite the destruction of his body. It was this lingering evil power that had drawn the Hero of Light into the land of Hyrule, and upon the summit the hero travels once more into another world to engage in a desperate final battle with the Demon King in a new version of Ganon's Tower.

The hero's solar system has been invaded by a group of yellow balls wearing triangular shades, and he jumps into action to send them packing. \n \nSupapoon is inspired by games like Breakout and Arkanoid, but offers a few twists of its own, like being able to project the ball with additional power by using the \"paddle\"'s intrinsic elasticity, and a constant timer that ticks down faster whenever the paddle takes damage from skull drops or enemy attacks. \n \nThe goal of the game is to reflect a ball of energy around a table, ensuring that it doesn't fall off the bottom of the screen. Rather than clearing all the blocks on the screen, which is common for other games of this type, the player only has to remove the yellow balls wearing shades to clear a level. They will receive a bonus for clearing the screen, however. \n \nOccasionally, items will drop from the destroyed blocks. These include extending and shrinking the paddle, adding more balls, extra lives and power stars. By collecting power stars, the player can increase the strength that the ball leaves the paddle, causing more damage to blocks. If the player finds four stars, this charged up bounce will clear the screen. \n \nSkulls can often drop from blocks too, and collecting these will lower a green gauge at the side of the screen, which operates as a combined timer/health bar.","popularity":1.0,"games":[68324,36608,47823,12632,34919,27209,36926,82853,42553,16468],"tags":[1,536871208,536875071],"category":0,"keywords":[296,4159],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":812937600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":812937600000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Oct-06","y":1995,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":815616000000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Nov-06","y":1995,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qsqfdmv4dhyegd0p9fkw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qsqfdmv4dhyegd0p9fkw","width":525,"height":943}},{"id":42325,"name":"Puzzle'n Desu","slug":"puzzlen-desu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puzzlen-desu","created_at":1499072347198,"updated_at":1516637565442,"summary":"A puzzle game for the Super Famicom where the hero has to push blocks across a grid to complete lines of the same color.","popularity":1.0,"games":[26223,60044,25222,14047,79094,78652,70388,66469,66392,65312],"tags":[268435465,536871208,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[296,2875],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":797817600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":797817600000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Apr-14","y":1995,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hkwpqfldzxz97hvdi7m4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hkwpqfldzxz97hvdi7m4","width":640,"height":343}},{"id":42326,"name":"Great Battle II: Last Fighter Twin","slug":"great-battle-ii-last-fighter-twin","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/great-battle-ii-last-fighter-twin","created_at":1499072350898,"updated_at":1500603718362,"summary":"Heroes unite!

As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity. What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too. This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.

Events can be played with up to 4 players.","popularity":1.0,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":752112000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":752112000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Nov-01","y":1993,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nanpndcmby7cgnacrpgz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nanpndcmby7cgnacrpgz","width":1024,"height":703}},{"id":42432,"name":"First Queen","slug":"first-queen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/first-queen","created_at":1499073619754,"updated_at":1516753637148,"summary":"First Queen (ファーストクイーン, \"First Queen\") is a real-time strategy-action RPG video game developed by Kure Software.

Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer. Combat, obstacles and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role. There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement, dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro and mines. Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks and armor. There are full race season, single race and custom track modes. In 1 player games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each associated with their own vehicle. In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st; often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before. Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can set the track's laps, gravity and starting line type. Each track section can be pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and converging multiple paths in any direction and a criss-cross. Either a horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid. The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1 forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6 slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1), inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved. Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs, valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2 and AI players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,76259,76110,19376,67842,64690,64496,63211,63210],"tags":[268435466,536875046],"category":0,"keywords":[4134],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/md6wvdyy8hccsqxqjz3t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"md6wvdyy8hccsqxqjz3t","width":2100,"height":1494}},{"id":42467,"name":"Rival Turf!","slug":"rival-turf","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rival-turf","created_at":1499073859660,"updated_at":1518082638759,"summary":"LOOK OUT, STREET SCUM!

Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania! \n \n\"Monstania\" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the \"enemy turn\". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.","popularity":2.0,"games":[26766,27092,12632,36926,36534,22258,18398,17583,29173,75813],"tags":[268435468,268435471,536871208,536871938,536874694,536875472,536880312],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,3782,4560,9400],"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":823132800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":823132800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Feb-01","y":1996,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/axrfi0bbqijeuvdq4lur.jpg","cloudinary_id":"axrfi0bbqijeuvdq4lur","width":1302,"height":700}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ulmsxbe79vcgxdq1iqis.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ulmsxbe79vcgxdq1iqis","width":500,"height":269}},{"id":42487,"name":"Mohawk \u0026 Headphone Jack","slug":"mohawk-and-headphone-jack","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mohawk-and-headphone-jack","created_at":1499074057759,"updated_at":1534173653616,"summary":"Protean platform hero with attitude (well, with sunglasses) rocks out in this novel but forgotten would-be Sonic-killer, collecting CDs (this is pre-Napster, remember) and avoiding segmented slinkies and nasty robot bugs in disorienting mode 7 mazes with no constant \"down\". \n \nThe boneless wonder (er, and his Walkman) pours himself into cracks, splatters against walls, curls into a defensive porcupine-koosh hybrid, always lands on his feet (by growing feet where his hands were!) and blasts apart into little jelly gibs as a special offensive attack.

Designer Toshio Iwai was inspired by his earlier interactive installation art piece titled Music Insects, to develop a video game at Nintendo between 1993 and late 1994. The completed product was inexplicably canceled by Nintendo, and the game's key elements were later developed into Maxis's 1996 PC game release titled SimTunes. \n \nSound Fantasy contains eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics. Music games, especially on home consoles, were not popular in the early 1990s, and it wouldn't be until much later in the decade that they gained mainstream attention.[citation needed] The Sound Fantasy prototype contains four different games in one cartridge. \n \nPix Quartet was inspired by Toshio Iwai's Music Insects. There are four insects of different colors, where the player can select different insect to each represent a different instrument. They crawl all over the screen, where the player can draw. Insects that crawl over a colored pixel make a note. Each color represents a different note for each insects. Sample Demos can be loaded to demonstrate the capabilities of this game. \n \nBeat Hopper contains three different modes: A-type, B-type and Training. A-type is a rhythm game in the style of Q-bert, where an insect on a pogo must make every block disappear after stepping on it as many times needed. Each block makes its own sound and the order does not matter. The player can improvise a song with each block. B-type requires the player to follow a path of blocks that appears every time the player touches one. The player must make as many steps as possible without losing three lives. \n \nIce Sweeper indicates two modes: A-type and B-type. This game is a Breakout clone with a few new twists added after a few stages, such as four bats controlled by a single player. \n \nStar Fly is inspired by music boxes, where the player can set a sequence of stars in the sky, to compose a song. A higher star corresponds to a higher musical note. The player may set the speed and the tone.","popularity":1.0,"games":[75245,6080,101956,101659,100916,100909,100767,99181,95874,88903],"tags":[268435463],"category":0,"genres":[7]},{"id":42523,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Parallel Worlds","slug":"the-legend-of-zelda-parallel-worlds","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-parallel-worlds","created_at":1499074801669,"updated_at":1516157642326,"summary":"A Spanish exclusive 2D side-scrolling adventure game.","collection":4965,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,22425,25222,26766,41895,55803,55935,11296,19289,29730],"tags":[268435487,536871139,536871776,536871939,536871980,536872647,536875101,536875151,536875228,536875420,536875440,536875485,536875537,536875665,536875760,536875792,536876373,536876620,536880232],"category":0,"keywords":[227,864,1027,1068,1735,4189,4239,4316,4508,4528,4573,4625,4753,4848,4880,5461,5708,9320],"genres":[31],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xcyp9vrvtfx938ln7qku.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xcyp9vrvtfx938ln7qku","width":765,"height":476}},{"id":42524,"name":"Super Metroid: Phazon","slug":"super-metroid-phazon","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-metroid-phazon","created_at":1499074803353,"updated_at":1499075523909,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":42525,"name":"Super Mario World: Return to Dinosaur Land","slug":"super-mario-world-return-to-dinosaur-land","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-world-return-to-dinosaur-land","created_at":1499074805401,"updated_at":1525701608478,"summary":"Super Mari World - Maro Classic Game S.N.E.S","rating":45.77221,"popularity":1.0,"total_rating":45.77221,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=classic.snesgame.smaroworld\u0026hl=en\u0026gl=us"}]},{"id":42526,"name":"Melfand Stories","slug":"melfand-stories","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/melfand-stories","created_at":1499074807327,"updated_at":1515781456835,"summary":"Melfand Stories is a Japan-exclusive Scrolling beat 'em up video game, developed by Sting Entertainment and published by ASCII, which was released in 1994.

Familiss, as the name might suggest, is a family mode for up to four players simultaneously. Sparkliss, meanwhile, is very similar to Bombliss from Super Tetris 2, only with a medieval fantasy theme and different explosion patterns. Sparkliss includes both a stage mode and a puzzle mode. \n \nThe most unique mode is Magicaliss, which has never shown up on any other version of Tetris. In Magicaliss, pieces come in three basic colors, and by rotating the piece, the player can choose between them. Creating a line entirely out of one color will clear all blocks on the screen of that color. There are also grey pieces, which can only be cleared by creating a line made entirely from one color, which will cause all grey blocks on screen to become that color. There are also rare rainbow pieces which will act as any color. Besides these additions, the game itself is basic Tetris. \n \nTetris Classic, Sparkliss, and Magicaliss can also be played in a two-player battle mode, besides the four-player Familiss mode.","collection":516,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,25646,60044,14047,36608,26223,34919,56292,16468,27266],"tags":[1,268435465,536873064,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[2152,2875],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":790214400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":790214400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jan-16","y":1995,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/blxrps4uua36nkwffg59.jpg","cloudinary_id":"blxrps4uua36nkwffg59","width":385,"height":213}},{"id":42532,"name":"Yuu Yuu Hakusho: Tokubetsu Hen","slug":"yuu-yuu-hakusho-tokubetsu-hen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yuu-yuu-hakusho-tokubetsu-hen","created_at":1499074818901,"updated_at":1516661557253,"summary":"Yuu Yuu Hakusho: Tokubetsu Hen is an Action game, developed and published by Namco, which was released in Japan in 1994.","collection":3874,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,44076,19934,18167,13189,76731,29173,26914,25311,19847],"tags":[1,19,268435471,536870926,536870990,536872032,536873299,536873476,536874694,536875053],"category":0,"keywords":[14,78,1120,2387,2564,3782,4141],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":788054400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":788054400000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Dec-22","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":790732800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jan-22","y":1995,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eigwc4lglhhzmvkivclw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eigwc4lglhhzmvkivclw","width":600,"height":1085}},{"id":42533,"name":"Soul \u0026 Sword","slug":"soul-and-sword","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/soul-and-sword","created_at":1499075006742,"updated_at":1516690563183,"summary":"Soul \u0026 Sword (ソウル アンド ソード?) is a 1993 Japanese-only video game on Super Famicom developed by Pandora Box.

The gameplay hinges upon two elements: blocks and potions, the latter of several colours. Hakku makes its way through levels by changing the position of blocks — that will be done by swallowing them to release them on an other place then — and sucking potions — that are to be injected to blocks by the beak, endowing them with new properties consequential to the colour of the fluid — from jars. A level is cleared when the rainbow shards in it are collected. Neither a time limit nor enemy characters are there impeding Hakkun's way. Equally distinctive is the score system: a set number of points is given at the beginning of each level, and a decrease happens with any move made, thus rewarding the player for completing levels with as little moves as possible. \n \nBefore reaching the format of a common Super Famicom cartridge, the game was released for and downloadable by the console's add-on Satellaview in four versions.

The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called \"Soul Power\", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.","popularity":1.0,"games":[29348,26765,18398,26951,59427,27092,28182,36926,8802,22387],"tags":[268435468,536871138,536871208,536871327,536871938,536875361,536875472,536880667],"publishers":[1854],"category":0,"keywords":[226,296,415,1026,4449,4560,9755],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":836179200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":836179200000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Jul-01","y":1996,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f7wdxmu6kgbtbfmvzbf5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f7wdxmu6kgbtbfmvzbf5","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pmoqhskniigouoqvuij0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pmoqhskniigouoqvuij0","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tckkejw8cnfhlfr7rwza.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tckkejw8cnfhlfr7rwza","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iq4bnwepfzlqxjnogvnm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iq4bnwepfzlqxjnogvnm","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jufi9luxpvwa3yvsnksh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jufi9luxpvwa3yvsnksh","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y5o8jjhl5j6i8hhd6x9o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y5o8jjhl5j6i8hhd6x9o","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lwxsmcqk3ndnpjtanxiv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lwxsmcqk3ndnpjtanxiv","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ojjqlzj7pm8wey1cg1xm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ojjqlzj7pm8wey1cg1xm","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dzbpr2odxmzewuhnt3ye.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dzbpr2odxmzewuhnt3ye","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rq5ujk31km0rephvsi3i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rq5ujk31km0rephvsi3i","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lmnctd6c7g5spncmxu67.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lmnctd6c7g5spncmxu67","width":880,"height":672},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u0f39boazummqnfgdcvi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u0f39boazummqnfgdcvi","width":880,"height":672}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p2duel3xqbhxgfhoewme.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p2duel3xqbhxgfhoewme","width":500,"height":274}},{"id":42563,"name":"Dai-4-Ji Super Robot Taisen","slug":"dai-4-ji-super-robot-taisen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dai-4-ji-super-robot-taisen","created_at":1499075281414,"updated_at":1515756967255,"summary":"Dai-4-Ji Super Robot Taisen is a Sci-Fi Turn-Based Strategy game, developed and published by Banpresto, which was released in Japan in 1995.","collection":3051,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[37478,6623,78949,80755,37481,21405,37479,72768,45376,72841],"tags":[18,268435471,536870990,536874694,536876985,536880451,536880629,536880631,536881795,536881799,536882300,536882301,536882981,536882982,536883076,536883149,536883175,536883176,536883177,536883366,536883528,536884879,536884880,536884881],"category":0,"keywords":[78,3782,6073,9539,9717,9719,10883,10887,11388,11389,12069,12070,12164,12237,12263,12264,12265,12454,12616,13967,13968,13969],"themes":[18],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Dai-4-Ji Super Robot Taisen Scramble","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Dai-4-Ji Super Robot Taisen S","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Super Robot Wars 4","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u5incuwwxvyuecx4wper.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u5incuwwxvyuecx4wper","width":500,"height":908}},{"id":42564,"name":"Dai-3-Ji Super Robot Taisen","slug":"dai-3-ji-super-robot-taisen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dai-3-ji-super-robot-taisen","created_at":1499075283571,"updated_at":1499075555805,"popularity":1.0,"category":0},{"id":42565,"name":"Corn Buster","slug":"corn-buster","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/corn-buster","created_at":1499075284884,"updated_at":1513018823427,"summary":"Corn Buster is an unreleased Super Nintendo game developed by Engine Software.

Turret controls are more limited, only allowing the player to aim left and right, fire the gun and zoom.","popularity":1.0,"games":[29173,19934,55590,18623,640,25311,9199,23345,19376,55689],"tags":[1,268435469,268435471,536870931,536870968,536871904,536872060,536874694,536875137],"category":0,"keywords":[19,56,992,1148,3782,4225],"themes":[1],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":806889600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":806889600000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jul-28","y":1995,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hj67l2mmrxniztz7zt9s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hj67l2mmrxniztz7zt9s","width":407,"height":283}},{"id":42633,"name":"Brett Hull Hockey","slug":"brett-hull-hockey","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/brett-hull-hockey","created_at":1499076463012,"updated_at":1515722254865,"summary":"The Golden Brett returns to the SNES in the improved and updated BRETT HULL HOCKEY ’95.

This character just keeps walking around and gets scared at the silliest things. While he aimlessly wanders around the playfield, Tetris like pieces fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and position them in the scene. Once in place, these blocks can be used by Gussun to climb on to reach new areas, and eventually lead him through the exit door. Tons of other features are also packed with the game, such as bombs or little buddies who follow Gussun to the exit (collect 10 of them for an extra life!). Time is of course limited and water starts filling up the stage if players stay in one levels for too long.

Success is not based solely on the types of tower you select, but where you place them and what upgrade and bonus options you take. \n \nAt your disposal are eleven flavors of towers, each of which can be upgraded to level 10 (increasing the tower’s damage and range). The Green Lasers, for example, lock onto one Vectoid and deal ongoing damage. The Red Spammer fires heat-seeking rockets at random targets in range. Blue Ray towers drain power and cause Vectoids to slow down. The in-game guide lists each tower in detail. Every few waves you’ll also be rewarded with a Yellow Energy Cell, which you can use to purchase one of three Boosts. Damage and Range Booster towers can be placed on a grid to increase the stats of other towers around it. \n \nVector TD for PSP features eight maps (two Beginner, three Normal, three Extreme) as well as all eleven tower and seven enemy types of the original Flash version. Exclusive to the minis version is a brand-new control interface — you’ll be able to select each gri’ using the D-pad or analog stick and place/upgrade towers.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19376,60044,19934,18167,29173,25222,18918,19301,55036,23345],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536870989,536872407,536873787,536874694,536875046,536875347,536875638],"category":0,"keywords":[77,1495,2875,3782,4134,4435,4726],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":1270339200000,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1270339200000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Apr-04","y":2010,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ldbcom0whtvrlqsvfrza.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ldbcom0whtvrlqsvfrza","width":728,"height":544}},{"id":42805,"name":"Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007","slug":"tiger-woods-pga-tour-2007","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tiger-woods-pga-tour-2007","created_at":1499081452688,"updated_at":1500581071570,"summary":"Take the road to the PGA Championship with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07.

To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns.

Players use pistols, machine guns, assault rifles, and explosives to kill various human enemies (e.g., criminals, police officers). When close to an enemy, players are able to shoot them in the head or knock them out with a black jack. Players have the ability to kill captives after (mostly) off-screen interrogations. Cutscenes depict further instances of violence (e.g., a man stabbed in the neck and shot multiple times). Combat is highlighted by cries of pain, blood-splatter effects, and realistic gunfire. The game includes several depictions of topless female characters. One prolonged scene depicts a topless women standing in a bedroom; another sequence depicts close-ups of topless women sitting down. The game also includes a few instances of sexual activity, including an obscured depiction of masturbation; a woman performing fellatio on a man; and a man thrusting against a woman from behind—camera angles obscure the sex act and no nudity is shown. During the course of the game, the central character is sometimes consumes large amounts of alcohol (the screen turns blurry); one sequence depicts characters using needles to inject themselves with drugs.

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","collection":2128,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":20741,"games":[23175,59516,55289,37022,25646,25311,12579,44191,26192,42080],"tags":[1,23,268435480,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1,23],"genres":[24,31],"first_release_date":1323302400000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1323302400000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Dec-08","y":2011,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xvtlixzwqyqkj5gmjz1a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xvtlixzwqyqkj5gmjz1a","width":1500,"height":825}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yq0xdpunqwkfhl72roas.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yq0xdpunqwkfhl72roas","width":1066,"height":1500}},{"id":42982,"name":"Dark Souls - Limited Edition","slug":"dark-souls-limited-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-souls-limited-edition","created_at":1499085070799,"updated_at":1500568350307,"summary":"A spiritual successor to Demons Souls, the action RPG Dark Souls is set in a rich, dark fantasy universe.

Like the original version, the player's movements and combat system are directed using the console gamepad, which comprises the left thumbstick, two attack buttons, and a block button. The game features a large selection of weapons for Ryu to wield each with advantages and disadvantages that affect the way the player approaches combat. A new addition to Ryu's arsenal is a pair of dual-wield swords, Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang. It also provides Ryu with magical spells in the form of ninpo, which allows him to inflict heavy damage on enemies while potentially avoiding damage himself. By shaking the Sixaxis controller, players are able to increase the power of their ninpo spells. Rachel, a non-playable character in the 2004 game, became playable in three new chapters, featuring the new bosses, Gamov and Alterator. Some of the design elements of the old levels was also changed and several new enemy types were introduced. \n \nIn addition to the narrative Story Mode, Sigma included a gameplay variation called Mission Mode. Focused on action rather than character development, this provides combat-based missions set mainly in small areas. In both Story and Mission modes, game scoring is based on the player's speed in clearing encounters, the number of kills achieved, the number of unused ninpos remaining at the end, and the amount of cash collected. Players can compare their scores on online ranking boards. In addition, players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.","popularity":1.0,"games":[23175,37022,55289,42080,59516,44191,12579,25646,25311,1221],"tags":[1,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1186099200000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1186099200000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Aug-03","y":2007,"m":8}]},{"id":43005,"name":"Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe Kollector's Edition","slug":"mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe-kollectors-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mortal-kombat-vs-dc-universe-kollectors-edition","created_at":1499085428137,"updated_at":1500567670429,"summary":"The game takes place after Raiden, Earthrealm's god of thunder, and Superman, protector of Earth, repel invasions from both their worlds.

A blend of exciting arcade style combat and stealth mechanics packed with amazing graphics in a moody, immersive setting, Batman: Arkham Asylum offers diverse gameplay options that push the envelope for all action, adventure and superhero games. \n'Batman: Arkham Asylum' game logo \nBatman in hand to hand combat in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum' \nKick it in combat gameplay. \nView larger. \nBatman gliding in on an enemy in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum' \nAnd stealth action. \nView larger. \nThe Joker in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum' \nMatch wits with The Joker. \nView larger. \nThe batarang in flight in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum' \nUtilize utility belt gadgets. \nView larger. \nThe huge Killer Croc in 'Batman: Arkham Asylum' \nTake on dangerous bosses. \nView larger. \nStory \nBatman: Arkham Asylum features an original story penned exclusively for the game by famous Batman author and five-time Emmy award winner, Paul Dini, whose credits include \"Lost\" season one and \"Batman: The Animated Series.\" As the game begins Batman is personally delivering his nemesis, The Joker, to the asylum at Arkham Island, but he is uneasy. Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot? \n \nGameplay \nIn Batman: Arkham Asylum players strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is. \n \nIn addition to the story-driven single player campaign Arkham Asylum also contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies. \n \nKey Features \n \nUtilize the unique FreeFlow combat system to chain together unlimited combos seamlessly and battle with huge groups of The Joker's henchmen in brutal melee brawls. \nInvestigate as Batman, the world's greatest detective, by solving intricate puzzles with the help of cutting edge forensic tools including x-ray scanning, fingerprint scans, 'Amido Black' spray and a pheromone tracker. \nFace off against Gotham's greatest villains including The Joker, Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc. \nBecome the Invisible Predator with Batman's fear takedowns and unique vantage point system to move without being seen and hunt enemies. \nChoose multiple takedown methods, including swooping from the sky and smashing through walls, and use the predator camera get a closer look at the action. \nExplore every inch of Arkham Asylum and roam freely on the infamous island, presented for the first time ever in its gritty and realistic entirety. \nExperience what it's like to be Batman using batarangs, explosive gel aerosol, the Batclaw, sonar resonator and the line launcher. \nUnlock more secrets by completing hidden challenges in the world and develop and customize equipment by earning experience points. \nEnjoy complete superhero freedom in the environment with the use of Batman's grapple to get to any place you can see, jump from any height and glide in any direction.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":500,"version_title":"Collector's Edition","games":[25640,25311,36608,34919,11362,9760,33603,36962,40524,55888],"tags":[1,268435471],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":1253836800000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1253836800000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Sep-25","y":2009,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xbwrw7ytgea7k2m2vm0s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xbwrw7ytgea7k2m2vm0s","width":650,"height":475}},{"id":43019,"name":"Batman: Arkham City - Collector's Edition","slug":"batman-arkham-city-collectors-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-arkham-city-collectors-edition","created_at":1499085744930,"updated_at":1532945459656,"summary":"Developed by Rocksteady Studios, Batman: Arkham City builds upon the intense, atmospheric foundation of Batman: Arkham Asylum, sending players soaring into Arkham City, the new maximum security home for all of Gotham Citys thugs, gangsters and insane criminal masterminds.

The Pump It Up dance mat is different from the norm as the arrows are set on diagonals and includes a button in the middle which allows for more complexity in the dance moves that are required to be performed in the game. \n \nThe general gameplay has the player watching a music video as symbols scroll by. The player must match the symbols on the screen with the symbols on the Pump It Up dance pad with their feet. Hitting the arrows in sync with the music will keep the players life bar up and give the player a good rating, while doing the opposite will drain the life bar and give bad ratings. If the life bar drains all the way, the game ends. \n \nThe game has several mode to choose from: \nArcade Mode has the player trying to achieve an “A” or an “S” rating on three consecutive songs. Doing that allows the player to play an extra song. Successfully completing songs in the Arcade mode opens them for play in Home Mode. \nHome Mode allows the player to choose any song they have available to them. \nSudden Death Mode forces the player to perform a song flawlessly or the game ends. \nSurvival Mode - This mode becomes available after the player completes twenty songs in the Home Mode. This is an endurance test for the player, as the game keeps giving the players songs to go through until their life bar is finally depleted. \nVideo Mode - This mode is unlocked after the player completes a total of twenty songs in either Home or Arcade Mode. It allows the player to just watch the videos for any song they've completed. \nTutorial mode - Teaches the player how the game works. \nThe game also keeps track of the players statistics (the rating grades they received for each song). \n \nThe PS2 version of the game features 101 songs, while the Xbox version contains 97 songs, but offers the option to download more songs. As some songs are more difficult then others, the game provides a rating from one to twenty to inform the player on just how hard of a task they are taking on by choosing a particular song.Two dance mats will be required for some songs that offer a freestyle option if the player chooses that setting.","collection":3719,"popularity":1.0,"games":[34919,36608,16468,17537,76219,34060,59516,43744,40680,23175],"tags":[1,268435463,536872407,536872862,536875049,536876199,536878193,536880243,536883765],"category":0,"keywords":[1495,1950,4137,5287,7281,9331,12853],"themes":[1],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":1128729600000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1128729600000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Oct-08","y":2005,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhaor0klumb1pzzetorn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fhaor0klumb1pzzetorn","width":320,"height":396}},{"id":43314,"name":"Jampack: Volume 14","slug":"jampack-volume-14","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jampack-volume-14","created_at":1499093752000,"updated_at":1500550520378,"summary":"This version of JAMPACK VOLUME 14 includes games rated M and is generally for older gamers, although it does includes games rated E and T.

The battle system is divided into two main parts; ground combat and air combat.

The game begins at the start of the series and ends at the ending of the second film. The game plays in an action game format with a standard third person view.

It is also the prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space. \n \nThe English dub of the video game features the voices of the actors who were cast for the Mobile Suit Gundam television series as with most games subsequent to the series' dubbing, rather than the English cast of the films. \n \nJourney to Jaburo takes place during the One Year War, and depicts the crew of the White Base making their way from the Side 7 sector of space colonies to the Federation headquarters at Jaburo. The game starts at Amuro Ray's home of Side 7, where three Zaku mobile suits attack the Federation's prototype mobile suit weapons. Amuro, in the confusion, fights the Zaku units in the Gundam, and is assigned to the White Base as the Gundam's pilot. After the White Base leaves the colony, it is pursued by Char Aznable, \"The Red Comet\". \n \nChar attacks the White Base during re-entry (where the power of the Gundam's beam rifle was revealed), which diverts them into the Zeon-controlled territory of North America. After going through many Zeon defenses (including Garma Zabi in Seattle), the White Base heads into Asia, where they battle Ramba Ral, an ace pilot who raised Sayla Mass when she was a child. After Ramba Ral commits suicide by jumping into Gundam's hand with a grenade, the White Base crew makes their way to Belfast for repairs. \n \nAfter they leave Belfast, they eventually make it to Jaburo, where Char's \"Mad Angler\" squadron finds the location of the base, and launches a massive attack to conquer it. The Zeon forces are beaten back, and the White Base, now dubbed the \"13th Autonomous Mobile Squadron\", heads out into space.","collection":3257,"franchise":820,"franchises":[820],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[22406,51464,34919,44242,19934,18623,22470,29173,19847,22425],"tags":[1,268435469,536870990,536871487,536871859,536872060,536875053,536875054,536875870,536877592,536882298],"developers":[617],"publishers":[617],"category":0,"keywords":[78,575,947,1148,4141,4142,4958,6680,11386],"themes":[1],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":999734400000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":999734400000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Sep-06","y":2001,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dbcikltwj1gbsnlyczou.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dbcikltwj1gbsnlyczou","width":281,"height":400},"esrb":{"rating":5}},{"id":43462,"name":"Furry Tales","slug":"furry-tales","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/furry-tales","created_at":1499154078102,"updated_at":1515739494191,"summary":"After a thousand years of Warfare, the conflict between Sheep and Wolves has entered a new and delirious age : secret and terrifying weapons may soon change the course of the war! \n \nThis full-3D action-RTS is filled with humor and high explosives, as sheep and wolves go at it for the survival and status of their species.

The Original Concept for Karaoke Revolution was created by Scott Hawkins and Sneaky Rabbit Studios.[1] Technology and concepts from the game were subsequently incorporated into Harmonix's game Rock Band. \n \nThe Japanese versions of the game are developed by Konami themselves. The gameplay also differs significantly. Rather than a game per se, it is merely a karaoke system for the PlayStation 2, with no judgments. \n \nThe game does not attempt to understand the singer's words, but instead detects their pitch. As such, singers can hum to a song or sing different lyrics without penalty. The game adapts to the player singing in a different octave than the song, to accommodate players whose vocal ranges do not fit the song. \n \nThe songs in the game are covers of pop hits frequently sung in karaoke bars. This contrasts with the SingStar series from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which features only original artist recordings along with the music videos, where available. However, the 2009 remake of the game (titled Karaoke Revolution, just like the original) features all master tracks.[2]","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":43498,"name":"Chroma Blast","slug":"chroma-blast","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chroma-blast","created_at":1499154589446,"updated_at":1523343346750,"summary":"Chroma Blast is a fast paced twin stick shooter with many different styles of play where you fight through waves of enemies while constantly leveling up your ships colorful arsenal.

The game, released in the year 1999 along with Alex Builds His Farm (1999), is based on the medieval castle toy series from Playmobil. The U.S. version of the Game Boy Color version was supposed to be released in June 2000,[5] but was delayed for over a year for some reason. The game revolves around Hype, a 22-year-old knight in the service of King Taskan IV, following a quest through time to return to his own era in order to save the kingdom from the evil black knight Barnak. The game was directed by Alain Tascan and featured thirty-two different voice actors,[6] as well as original music by Robbi Finkel.","storyline":"The story begins during King Taskan IV's reign, following the end of a civil war. Hype, the champion of the kingdom, is being rewarded for his loyalty and valor by being presented with the powerful Sword of Peace. However, during the ceremony a mysterious and powerful black knight riding a dragon unexpectedly appears. The knight steps to the King and demands the throne. At that moment, Hype steps before the knight and attempts to confront him, but the black knight is too strong and with the use of powerful magic, transforms Hype into a statue of stone and casts him deep into the past. Two hundred years earlier, Hype's statue appears in the courtyard of an apprentice magician: Gogoud. \n \nAfter many failed attempts to revive Hype, the young magician, Gogoud, manages to restore Hype to life. As Hype recovers his memory he quickly explains his ordeal with the black knight - known as Barnak - and how he must return to his own time in order to protect his king, take revenge on Barnak and marry his betrothed, Vibe. Sorrowfully, Gogoud explains that he as a magician is not very experienced and is as currently only an apprentice. Still, the young man agrees to help Hype and guide him on his quest through time. Gogoud comes to learn that in order for Hype to return to the future, he must collect a number of jewels. Both are dismayed to learn that each Jewel only allows Hype to advance one leap through time, meaning that he will have to collect and charge jewels hidden in the reigns of Taskan I, II and III before returning to the era of Taskan IV. Throughout his journey, Hype meets a number of faithful friends, including: Zatila the dragon, Karon, leader of the brigands, her daughter Nohlin and many others. On the other hand, Hype also encounters a great number of foes including King Taskan I and his followers; Rajoth the magician - founder of the Laboratories; Enost - King Taskan III's wizard, who defects to the Barnak's side; numerous different soldiers, including Barnak's armies of Black Guards and other servants; Barnak's black dragon Vhoid and finally the evil Barnak himself. Hype also confronts many non-human enemies including wolves, spectres, bats and a three-headed dragon. Hype's adventures take place in the same kingdom throughout different periods of its history. Rivalries and wars erupt between the fortress, the monastery, the brigands and the magicians in the laboratories. Upon returning to his own time, Hype is reunited with Vibe and together they form an army in order to begin an uprising against Barnak, who has taken control of the kingdom. His large army enforce his diabolical regime, forcing the kingdom's people to worship their master as a God, as well as a King. The entire kingdom is guarded by Barnak's evil minions, with the main areas of the Town of Torras, the Forest, Gogoud's Manor, the Brigand Village and the Fortress being closely watched, while 'un-necessary' areas such as the Monastery, Laboratories, and the Field of Courage are closed off at Barnak's command. Most disturbing however, it is due to Barnak's conquest the land has become desolate and a fiery sky above foreshadows Barnak's triumph - causing great sadness over the kingdom's people. The land however, is finally restored to its former beauty when the Black Knight is defeated - his dark magic that plagued the kingdom broken. The spirit of Gougoud tells tales of a new world as the story ends with peace returning to the land.","collection":4742,"hypes":1,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[47823,23175,55752,25300,36926,51485,26848,55092,59516,55289],"tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536871208,536871945,536875090,536878439,536882695,1073741826],"developers":[38],"publishers":[104],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,1033,4178,7527,11783],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":943056000000,"platforms":[6,22,8],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":22,"date":1009756800000,"region":8,"human":"2001","y":2001,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":8,"date":1009756800000,"region":8,"human":"2001","y":2001,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":943056000000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Nov-20","y":1999,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nllbfdxwbudq91hu4nwy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nllbfdxwbudq91hu4nwy","width":332,"height":400},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype:_The_Time_Quest"}]},{"id":43560,"name":"The Snow Queen Quest","slug":"the-snow-queen-quest","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-snow-queen-quest","created_at":1499155495778,"updated_at":1500545145355,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":43561,"name":"Woody Woodpecker: Escape from Buzz Buzzard Park","slug":"woody-woodpecker-escape-from-buzz-buzzard-park","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/woody-woodpecker-escape-from-buzz-buzzard-park","created_at":1499155498771,"updated_at":1516157689399,"summary":"Woody Woodpecker: Escape from Buzz Buzzard Park is an adventure game in the third person, in which the player controls his character in an environment modeled in computer graphics and real-time 3D , with the camera placed behind or around the figure.

Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect. \n \nWeapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[12632,36926,36608,16468,47823,26766,25300,59516,27209,68324],"tags":[1,268435468,536871123,536871208,536871938],"category":0,"keywords":[211,296,1026],"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":997660800000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":997660800000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Aug-13","y":2001,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xeqqtvkpj4gpqpa3siwb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xeqqtvkpj4gpqpa3siwb","width":640,"height":908}},{"id":43608,"name":"MX Rider","slug":"mx-rider","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mx-rider","created_at":1499156777422,"updated_at":1500542350950,"summary":"The complete motocross experience!

Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on.","collection":3075,"franchise":57,"franchises":[57],"popularity":3.0,"games":[29173,55036,19847,23345,19376,55590,12632,25921,27209,19934],"tags":[268435471,536870990,536871938,536874694,536875054,536875586,536875588,536877755],"category":0,"keywords":[78,1026,3782,4142,4674,4676,6843],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":1101513600000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1101513600000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Nov-27","y":2004,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/evs33bxj2yoyupfculbo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"evs33bxj2yoyupfculbo","width":1536,"height":2175},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":43618,"name":"Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament","slug":"smash-court-tennis-pro-tournament","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/smash-court-tennis-pro-tournament","created_at":1499157175070,"updated_at":1513070570357,"summary":"In this officially licensed tennis game from Namco, you can play in all four major tournaments of the tennis season: The Australian Open, Wimbeldon, the French Open and the US Open, with the best players in the world including Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt, Monica Seles and more from the top 8 of both the ATP and WTA tournaments.

It was first discovered by a tribe of ancient Polynesians who settled there and constructed a city in the meteorite crater. They worshipped the immense supernatural powers it appeared to hold, fashioning four artefacts out of the meteorite's core material (which become the focus of the game). Shortly thereafter, the tribe laid witness to the deformed birth of their prophesied leader, born without a face, and fled Antarctica in fear of what the meteorite was capable of. In the present day, the ancient Polynesian city has been buried beneath snow and ice and RX Tech are excavating the site, investigating the meteorite. Led by Dr. Willard, the crew discovers remnants of the Polynesian city, ancient stone statues resembling the Easter Island Moai, and finds the grave of a man named Paul Caulfield of the HMS Beagle. \n \nWhen the game begins, Lara Croft is in India searching for a legendary stone in the ruins of an ancient temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. She encounters Tony, an RX Tech employee who seems to be suffering from a severe bout of jungle fever. After parting ways, Tony remains one step ahead of Lara in their search for the stone, eventually finding it hidden deep within an underground cavern. After killing an oddly superhuman Tony, Lara takes the stone and exits. On her trek back to the Indian jungle, she is discovered by Dr. Willard.","popularity":1.0,"games":[23175,37022,55289,42080,59516,44191,12579,25646,25311,1221],"tags":[1,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pswj8zdl09ygo2xsp4vw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pswj8zdl09ygo2xsp4vw","width":1788,"height":1747}},{"id":43690,"name":"Tomb Raider Collector's Edition","slug":"tomb-raider-collectors-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tomb-raider-collectors-edition","created_at":1499160580871,"updated_at":1500531836887,"summary":"In Tomb Raider, the player controls the female archaeologist Lara Croft, in search for the three mysterious Scion artefacts across the world.

Ledges, walls and ceilings mostly sit at 90 degrees to each other, but sometimes feature sloping planes. \nThe object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill dangerous animals and other creatures, while collecting objects and solving puzzles to gain access to an ultimate prize, usually a powerful artefact.

This provokes much jealousy in Asuka, who also suspects that Kirishima is a spy who is trying to get information from Shinji about NERV and the Evas. Rei Ayanami is present but plays a rather background role in the story, though she seems to agree with the suspicions of Asuka. Gradually, a relationship between Mana and Shinji unfolds and they end up going on a date. It turns out, however, that Mana is one of three test pilots for the TRIDENT (alternatively named the \"Country Crawler\") units, a new competitor to the Evangelions, similar to Jet Alone; thus the name Girlfriend of Steel. Eventually, the TRIDENT goes berserk and the Evas have to destroy it. \n \nThe interactivity in most of the game is limited to walking around areas until the next plot event is triggered.

Shinji rescues her and brings her back to his apartment. She showers, emerges wearing only a towel, and teasingly asks Shinji if he would like her to remove it (which she eventually does). In discussion with Misato, however, it is agreed that Mana has to leave Tokyo-3, and she says a teary goodbye to Shinji who has won her heart. \n \nIn the Asuka ending, Asuka helps Shinji to get over Mana and the two children grow closer as a result. This ending contains romantic images of Asuka and Shinji together, including a moving scene where Asuka hugs Shinji emotionally. \n \nThe third ending with Kaji does not focus on any one character as much as the other endings do.

The game comes from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work. \n \nYou have a single ship choice and three difficulties. Gaming veterans will want to start on HARD, which differs only slightly if at all from NORMAL, and isn't particularly challenging anyway. You get two extra credits in NORMAL, for a total of 5, which is ample if you want to credit feed your way to the best ending. No one should touch EASY, since it limits you to reaching Stage 4. There are 7 stages with 3 possible endings, none of which are affected by credit usage. \n \nPower-ups consist of 2 main shots (RED and BLUE), 2 sub-weapons (YELLOW and GREEN), and an eIntense Shot' based on your main weapon which basically acts like a Power Bomb. Main weapons stack up to 3 times (RED: starts on 1 shot then 2, 3 and finally 4 shots), sub-weapons don't stack. Lose a ship and you lose your sub-weapon, while your main weapon goes down one level. \n \nBLUE is the Laser Shot, a straight line weapon with strong frontal attack which increases in thickness and power as you stack it. The laser's eintense shot' is a massive sausage of light cutting across the screen and wiping out all in its path. RED is Needle Shot. This is your typical V-shot weapon. Less powerful than BLUE, but when stacked 3 times has a wide ranging spread. The intense shot is a series of blue homing orbs target enemies and weak points on bosses, making this the best main weapon. GREEN is the Cipher Wave, the best sub-weapon since it fires four blobs which home in on enemies and can attack craft which are behind you, which is essential during boss fights. YELLOW is the Energy Blaster and acts like an additional V-shot weapon. Absolute rubbish. \n \nWith such a simple weapons set most players will opt for a RED and GREEN combo for the game's duration. Which isn't a criticism. Gaia Seed doesn't distract you with superfluity; it's functional, with a focus on dodging and shooting. What's especially cool, and sets it apart from other shmups, is that both your health bar and Intense Shot bar are continuously recharging. This effectively gives you infinitely spawning power bombs and infinite health - but it doesn't break the game's balancing. \n \nEnemies frequently use screen-filling beam-based draining weapons, forcing you to let off a volley of shots and then scramble out of the beam's attack before your life is fully drained. With bosses this creates some intense battles of endurance - especially if you're trying to beat them by letting the timer run down (those are some pretty intense 120 seconds). After escaping a draining blast you can lick your wounds at the screen's edge, healing while avoiding bullet patterns. The patterns are fairly busy but without ever reaching danmaku levels of weaving. A slight comparison could be made to Deep Blue on the PC Engine, which had a recharging health bar and encouraged enemy avoidance (as pointed out by Mag Weasel). \n \nA mention must go to Gaia Seed's timed bosses. Defeating them by letting the timer reach zero doesn't do much during the main game apart from giving you a sense of accomplishment, but if you want to see the best ending you'll let the two final Stage 7 bosses' live. \n \nVisually almost everything is sprite based, though it varies in terms of quality. The first stage contains hundreds of massive though pixelated objects moving around, while the second has some interesting Mode 7 styled screen rotation effects. Stage 3 contains some decent parallax scrolling, though not as good as in Thunder Force IV. Subsequent levels are reasonable but without flair. \n \nThe stand out element of Gaia Seed though has to be its soundtrack, which almost warrants download alone. It's extremely unconventional, being a blend of ambient music with chanting, classical music, hip-hop and thumping techno.

Galaxian3 has little or no connection to Namco's Galaxian coin-op classic, and the PlayStation edition is only available as a Japanese import, despite the fact that it did make it to some U.S. arcades. \n \nInspired by the \"walk-in\" theatrical-style arcade game, Galaxian3 is a blast-fest for up to four players. While the computer does the flying in this first-person shooter, the players are trigger-happy gunners with plenty of alien ships crowding the sky as targets. Everything, from stationary gun platforms on enormous alien command ships to agile fighters, is fair game. Occasionally reactors and other strategic targets must be hit, including one sequence that bears a bit of resemblance to a certain chase through a certain Death Star. \n \nThe complete arcade game is included, along with an original second \"mission\" involving an alien planet that must be saved.","collection":3307,"popularity":1.0,"games":[27314,68287,36950,7350,25657,1595,25300,7291,28029,29525],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536870915,536870918,536871078,536871219,536871365,536871882,536871904,536871937,536871970,536872352,536872390,536872651,536872696,536873064,536873186,536873874,536875199,536875242,536875271,536875426,536875558,536875610,536875611,536876391,536876923,536876953,536879182,536880256,536880371,536880858,1073741825],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"keywords":[3,6,166,307,453,970,992,1025,1058,1440,1478,1739,1784,2152,2274,2962,4287,4330,4359,4514,4646,4698,4699,5479,6011,6041,8270,9344,9459,9946],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":833068800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":833068800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-May-26","y":1996,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Galaxian 3","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ojzwwnapclbtmaurbxlp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ojzwwnapclbtmaurbxlp","width":850,"height":1112}},{"id":43775,"name":"Gokuu Densetsu - Magic Beast Warriors","slug":"gokuu-densetsu-magic-beast-warriors","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gokuu-densetsu-magic-beast-warriors","created_at":1499161923339,"updated_at":1516583177142,"summary":"A digitized fighting game based on Journey to the West.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,56987,1936,22418,6685,65832,76885,19333,16999,41819],"tags":[268435460,536871019,536871208,536871244,536871865,536875074,536875082,536875151,536875159,536875243,536875444,536877551,536877779],"category":0,"keywords":[107,296,332,953,4162,4170,4239,4247,4331,4532,6639,6867],"genres":[4],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/etxjemdgde5tauksxiwv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"etxjemdgde5tauksxiwv","width":600,"height":588}},{"id":43776,"name":"Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee Golf","slug":"peter-jacobsens-golden-tee-golf","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/peter-jacobsens-golden-tee-golf","created_at":1499161925122,"updated_at":1515660723357,"summary":"Based on the arcade hit, Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee Golf matches realistic gameplay with fun and easy-to-learn controls.

You begin at the Roadside Inn, but instead of walking around you have a menu on top of a loading screen that allows you to talk to different people, start a level, etc. \n \n- Another great feature is that you can buy items from the Expert for Gel.

There are three courses - Royal County Down, The Lost City and Couer D'Alene (plus Royal Birkdale on the North American edition).","popularity":1.0,"games":[78572,78392,45064,22690,54662,15851,81281,80876,80865,80456],"tags":[268435470,536872078,536875626],"category":0,"keywords":[1166,4714],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":925516800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":925516800000,"region":8,"human":"1999-May-01","y":1999,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/alofswy40gibvgtgefcl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"alofswy40gibvgtgefcl","width":226,"height":223}},{"id":43822,"name":"NCAA March Madness 2000","slug":"ncaa-march-madness-2000","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ncaa-march-madness-2000","created_at":1499164016710,"updated_at":1515839920275,"summary":"NCAA March Madness 2000 was the 1999 installment in the NCAA March Madness series.

The game also features 10 authentic tracks as well as realistic handling and damage. Players can compete in a full year's worth of races competing for points in each race or in simple single races. There are two game modes: arcade and simulation. Arcade mode allows re-spawning of damaged vehicle parts. In Simulation mode, all damage is permanent for the race. The game supports the analog controller. \n \nThe play can make many modifications to a car's performance. The player can: adjust the tires to fit the road (hard for ovals or soft for road courses), as well as modify gear ratios and aerodynamics. Moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings may enable the player to find a perfect combination of speed and handling. During simulation mode races, the car's tires will wear down and fuel will deplete (both can be replaced by a pit stop). \n \nIn addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included – each modeled after its real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience. In Season Mode, the player will take part in a series of races, for which the player must qualify and race, earning points toward a cup.","popularity":1.0,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":876960000000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":876960000000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Oct-16","y":1997,"m":10}]},{"id":43835,"name":"Mad Panic Coaster","slug":"mad-panic-coaster","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mad-panic-coaster","created_at":1499164057855,"updated_at":1516564024582,"summary":"The game was published by Hakuhodo in 1997, an advertising agency in Japan whose only other game is the RPG Himikoden: Renge.

It's up to you to steer the roller coaster car using the d-pad to make sure it stays on the track. The roller coasters also have various monsters, traps, and jumps to avoid. To do this, you use X to jump.
