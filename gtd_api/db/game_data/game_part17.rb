This will give them the edge to defeat the True Dragons, and stand a chance against the most powerful one of them all... the 7th Dragon: VFD. \n \nThe Launch Edition includes a 28 page art book.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1470960000000,"platforms":[37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1470960000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Aug-12","y":2016,"m":8}]},{"id":44020,"name":"The Legend of Legacy Launch Edition","slug":"the-legend-of-legacy-launch-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-legacy-launch-edition","created_at":1499171479063,"updated_at":1500313016801,"summary":"Seven adventurers are about to embark on the quest of a lifetime as they explore the island of Avalon and unravel the mysteries of its dark past.

Players relive lost memories by controlling the warrior's party around a world map and battling fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, sludge men, man-eating train) corrupted by evil. Players can use weapon attacks and magic spells to defeat enemies in turn-based combat. Damage is indicated by slashing effects, impact sounds, and colorful light flashes. The game contains some suggestive material: dialogue that states, “Thank the Goddess for big boobs,” “There's a rumor going around that the spring will clear up your skin and fill out your chest,” and “Let's go peep on the girls!!!”; one sequence depicts male characters spying on bathing female characters. During the course of the game, a character discusses and consumes alcohol (e.g., “Gulp. . .Gulp. . .Gulp. . . Full-bodied! Fragrant! All of it, first-class! . . . You must continue making this exquisite wine”). In one of the cities, there is a casino in which players can play a slot-machine mini-game; players can bet their in-game money, spin the five slots, and either lose or win. The words “a*s” and “bastard” appear within the text of the game.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Content

Do you agree that everything is fair in love and war? Would you like to take a chance with a new, refreshing indie strategy game? If your answer to these questions is yes, then I’m happy to introduce Diplomata the game to you!   \nThis cross platform multiplayer browser based strategy game is really worth giving it a try! Diplomata takes place in the end of the 21st century, after the collapse of the human civilization we know.   \nThe boundaries of the once-existed states have stayed the same, but some countries became more powerful than others. A player has to strive to build a country that’s wealthier than others, knowing that other players will try to achieve the same goal. So, it’s up to a player to use everything from diplomacy to war to develop the most powerful country. This is a turn-based game and a player gets 3 turns in every minutes (300 turns is maximum, though). Turns are made for developing of the country (improving industry, agriculture or building objects) and for interaction with allies and enemies (sending help, attacking, secret service actions etc.).   \nEvery player has enough time to analyze, think and plan before they make a turn. Plus, having equal number of turns enables equal game. Diplomata is also played in rounds with every round lasting one month and first day in the next month every player starts from zero, which gives all players opportunity to plan new round from the very beginning and, of course, to take revenge on enemies. If you like games that require both social and strategy skills and allow players to team up with other players or compete against them, Diplomata might be an ideal strategy game for you. With hundreds (and counting) players from all around the globe, this game promises a rewarding gaming experience. It’s perfect for those players who don’t fancy downloading or installing anything in order to play games, since it’s fully browser based.","storyline":"Diplomata takes place in the end of the 21st century, after the collapse of the human civilization we know.

This second season will also include Telltale's unique multiplayer 'Crowd Play' feature, which allows friends and family to engage with the adventure together by helping to decide the direction of the story from any mobile device with an online connection. \n \nNow that Jesse and the gang have vanquished the Wither Storm, saved the world, and become totally super famous heroes, life has gotten a bit more...complicated. With more responsibilities and less time for adventure, old friendships have started to fade -- at least until Jesse's hand gets stuck in a creepy gauntlet that belongs to an ancient underwater temple.

The Japanese branch of the Drexler Institute was annihilated by the European Celestial Union, but found new life as the Rosenberg Branch of the European Celestial Union. \n \nSoon after the Kantou Incident, large-scale dimensional rifts began to open all across Japan. This sudden uptick in celestial phenomena was seen as exceptionally odd by many, and some even whispered that it could be the result of secret research by the Drexler Institute. The Japanese branch of the Celestial Union was dispatched to investigate the phenomena, and they called on several angels from the National Academy of Metaphysics. \n \nSeveral angels from the Rosenberg Branch of the Celestial Union were also dispatched, but they were soon intercepted by the Aesir. \n \nOnly six days remain until the destruction of Japan. \"","collection":803,"rating":60.0,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"total_rating":60.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[5490,41828,10039,36926,22418,47823,65832,19333,16999,12632],"tags":[1,268435460,268435489,536871019,536871079,536871208,536871213,536875074,536875075,536875108,536875182,536875591,536875719,536875854,536876401,536877384,536879786,536879796,536880735,536881886,1073741828],"developers":[2436],"publishers":[2436,1218],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[107,167,296,301,4162,4163,4196,4270,4679,4807,4942,5489,6472,8874,8884,9823,10974],"themes":[1],"genres":[4,33],"first_release_date":1417651200000,"pulse_count":11,"platforms":[52,6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1513036800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-12","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1417651200000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Dec-04","y":2014,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Arcana Heart 3 LOVEMAX SIXSTARS!!!!!!"},{"name":"アルカナハート3 LM SSS","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"アルカナハート3 LOVE MAX SIX STARS!!!!!!","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wfyqeanpwjdvbg7hsgyj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wfyqeanpwjdvbg7hsgyj","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jofismanqrhsqoovqtdq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jofismanqrhsqoovqtdq","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lh1zuvhbmufcw7nv6cfz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lh1zuvhbmufcw7nv6cfz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mde24mh2kwfifhwqvcto.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mde24mh2kwfifhwqvcto","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iivydzhpy69ghqo9p8ut.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iivydzhpy69ghqo9p8ut","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"Vdi63FwfeLg"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rjwnq9evm7kgb6kg7h68.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rjwnq9evm7kgb6kg7h68","width":350,"height":170},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/661990"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.examu.co.jp/arcanaheart3lm_sss/"}],"external":{"steam":"661990"}},{"id":44229,"name":"Ether Awakening","slug":"ether-awakening","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ether-awakening","created_at":1499419530399,"updated_at":1522226484408,"summary":"After losing a war and being forced to abandon her homeland, Princess Nia can think only of revenge.

You search a massive persistent open world in search of food, drink, and shelter. \nThe game has a realistic, complex, yet intuitive crafting and skill system. Crafting in Vantage is heavily researched to be as realistically accurate as possible. For example: to create a primitive fire you must first create a wooden spindle and hearth, as well as find some tinder (dry grass for example). Then with these items you attempt to create a fire using the \"hand drill\" method. Crafting uses time and energy, as well as many skills which make your crafting easier. If your crafting skills are to low then you may fail at your professions until you work to get better at them. \nYou can brave the large world alone, or with friends online! Create your own village, or even an entire town with your friends. You can also gather your friends to go hunting for animals.

By providing different levels of difficulty, the series is suitable for children from the kindergarten age through grade eight. The Equations cartridge is divided into 26 levels of difficulty, covering material generally taught in grades six through eight. This program introduces the concept of variables — finding the value of an unknown number N — in equations. It also provides practice with a wide variety of skills related to solving equations, including working problems in more than one step and solving equations by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. This program assumes that your child has mastered basic arithmetic and a certain degree of mental computation.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":44353,"name":"Demonstration","slug":"demonstration","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/demonstration","created_at":1499421996014,"updated_at":1500623956366,"summary":"The Demonstration module has been carefully developed to provide a quick, thorough, enjoyable, and easy-to-use demonstration of the Texas Instruments Home Computer.

Math permeates every aspect of our lives — work, relaxation, entertainment. Its importance in the future to us and especially to our children will be even greater. Therefore, it is essential for all of us to know and understand how fundamental mathematics operations are performed. In order to develop this understanding, students must have the opportunity to practice, for only through practice can they develop strong mathematical skills. The Computer Math Games VI Solid State Cartridge is one of five modules of math games that can help provide this opportunity. The program was designed by Charles Lund, Supervisor of Mathematics for the St. Paul, Minnesota, public schools and the staff of Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in cooperation with the staff of Texas Instruments Incorporated. The games included in the cartridge are both fun and challenging, with an entertaining, motivating format designed to capture and hold attention. With this cartridge students will be able to: \n- develop math skills by playing four different, enjoyable math games using whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and integers. \n- have fun while practicing mathematics either alone or with other players or team members. \n- develop methods of problem-solving and decision-making. \nThe cartridge is designed to be versatile. It can be used in the home as well as the classroom. The team-use concept allows the cartridge to be used by large numbers of participants, and yet it is equally valuable to your child working alone at home to supplement lectures and homework. The cartridge is intended to be a supplementary aid for children from grades two through nine. It is assumed that the students have been exposed to basic math concepts. While even very young students can use the activities covering addition and subtraction of whole numbers, the cartridge can grow in application as your child grows in ability.","popularity":1.0,"category":0},{"id":44358,"name":"Computer Math Games II","slug":"computer-math-games-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/computer-math-games-ii","created_at":1499422016980,"updated_at":1500612580098,"popularity":1.0,"category":0},{"id":44359,"name":"Bomber","slug":"bomber","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bomber","created_at":1499422018916,"updated_at":1515810480580,"summary":"Bomb away the Skyscrapers to form a runway, before you crash.","popularity":1.0,"games":[34919,68287,25311,71455,28029,36950,25300,19341,64204,27314],"tags":[1,18,268435469,536871882],"category":0,"keywords":[970],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[13],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ifqcmc6isctmws2hyg1t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ifqcmc6isctmws2hyg1t","width":946,"height":936}},{"id":44360,"name":"Reading Fun","slug":"reading-fun","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/reading-fun","created_at":1499422021806,"updated_at":1500612562066,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":44361,"name":"Reading Roundup","slug":"reading-roundup","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/reading-roundup","created_at":1499422024794,"updated_at":1500612552923,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":44362,"name":"Rotor Raiders","slug":"rotor-raiders","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rotor-raiders","created_at":1499422026568,"updated_at":1500623957641,"summary":"Rotor Raiders is a game very similar to Pac-Man where instead of you are on cleanup.

Dramis later wrote Parsec for the TI-99/4A. \n \nThe player controls the Munch Man using either the keyboard or joystick. Like Pac-Man, the goal of a level is to visit every part of the maze, but instead of eating dots the player fills the maze with a chain pattern. Four Hoonos (the equivalent of Pac-Man ghosts) attempt to thwart Munch Man's efforts to complete his mission. However, Munch Man always has his \"Energizer\" (the equivalent of a Pac-Man power pill) which gives Munch Man the ability to devour the Hoonos. The game ends when the player's lives are depleted. \n \nIn level 20, 40, and 60, the maze is invisible and there are no chains. Instead, Munch Man must eat all the TI logos in the invisible maze.

An evil demon called Homncruse is poised to take over the World and only Ray and his friends can do something about it. He sets out on a journey to find five companions and the guardians who will eventually help him in his quest. The most interesting feature of the game is how the player controls two teams of heroes - the Aqutallions and the Kustera. Each party has special abilities and needs to be used in conjunction with one another for the most benefit. Aqutallion also cleverly mixes fantasy and technology and villains often rely on machines to fulfill their evil intentions. Beyond that, Aqutallion is a traditional Role Playing Game - our heroes travel the world, visit towns, villages, dungeons and gather clues. Combats are turned-based and are randomly triggered throughout the game, and their sole purpose is to gain experience points and to level up.

The driver's name and team can be entered using either English or Japanese letters. When a player beats a record, he or she is asked to insert his or her number, name or initials (up to four characters and two digits for the number). Championship mode can last for multiple seasons. Playing ninety-nine seasons in a single racing career is theoretically possible due to the double-digit nature of the season information. There are eight different tracks, including the Suzuka Circuit that has been shown in video games since Pole Position II and Fuji Speedway (complete with a virtually photorealistic Mount Fuji in the background). \n \nVersus mode is for two human players only and the record options allows the players to look at his or her previous records. In a race, there are up to fifteen opponents to race against. The player gets rewarded with an opportunity to upgrade his or her equipment after a top five finish on any race course. Bonus equipment includes a faster engine, better tires, and a special dose of nitrous oxide created specifically for Gran Turismo vehicles. All of the bonus automobile parts are automatically installed in the appropriate parts for supercharging the vehicle. Once all the special parts are earned, the automobile is considered to be fully upgraded. The ultimate goal is to win the Gran Turismo championship for his or her team in addition for him/herself. \n \nThe \"free practice\" is essentially a time trial mode where the player races by him/herself for up to ten laps.

The game is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University. \n \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level. \n \nThe main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of \"moves\" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results. \n \nObstacles in levels include: \n \nBoxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled. \nGlass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through. \nLaser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely end the level. \nSwitch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser beam to hit them. \nTeleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points. \nPolice officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be moved to alter the police officier's behavior. \nDetectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles. \nPQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends, and a \"weekly quiz\" that can be downloaded through the Internet.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,101563,106275,90108,10225,90766,87507,60044,86974,27266],"tags":[268435465,536893253,536893254],"category":0,"keywords":[22341,22342],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1184716800000,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1184716800000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Jul-18","y":2007,"m":7}]},{"id":44507,"name":"NeoGeo Heroes Ultimate Shooting","slug":"neogeo-heroes-ultimate-shooting","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/neogeo-heroes-ultimate-shooting","created_at":1499426098985,"updated_at":1534377133605,"summary":"10 great SNK heroes and heroines have left their worlds to answer Dr. Brown Sugar's \"call for peace\".

For it will be that power that will be used to resurrect the one whose life he stole. \n \nFor those who betray the divine will pay for their sins in the space which separates salvation and damnation, as will their progeny...","popularity":1.0,"version_parent":46031,"category":0,"first_release_date":1343347200000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1343347200000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Jul-27","y":2012,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/snw0m49yt3qgo9hg4mkl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"snw0m49yt3qgo9hg4mkl","width":1280,"height":720}},{"id":44565,"name":"Hakuoki: Stories of the Shinsengumi","slug":"hakuoki-stories-of-the-shinsengumi","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hakuoki-stories-of-the-shinsengumi","created_at":1499429907755,"updated_at":1528964751524,"summary":"Plot: Follow Chizuru, a young woman who finds herself fighting alongside the infamous Shinsengumi as competing factions war for control of Japan.

As players advance the storyline, they use swords, lances, guns, and colorful light attacks against fantasy creatures (e.g., plants monsters, dragons, robots). Combat is turn-based, and damage is indicated by impact sounds and a loss of hit points. During the course of the game, some female characters are dressed in low-cut outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and/or buttocks; one bathing sequence depicts female bodies partially obscured by hot-spring mist and soap suds.

The only known way of decreasing the player's Rank in Ibara is to die. The more lives you have, the less the rank decreases when you die.","storyline":"Ibara takes place in an alternate version of the 20th century.

However, a great threat appears: the insane Dr. Theresa Rose has decided that the human race is filthy and needs to be exterminated to make place for a beautiful rose garden, and her very first target is none other than Edelweiss. She and her five daughters (Lace, Shasta, Kasumi, and twin sisters Midi and Meidi) wreak havoc across the country under the name Rose Garden, leaving the Emperor with no choice but to send out his finest: the \"negotiators\" Bond and Dyne, to defeat the Rose Garden and save the country.","collection":952,"popularity":3.0,"games":[103298,103281,37605,21015,105042,32902,47626,44767,28029,103301],"tags":[268435461,536871756],"developers":[2958],"publishers":[1440,16252],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[844],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1121385600000,"platforms":[52,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1121385600000,"region":5,"human":"2005-Jul-15","y":2005,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1143072000000,"region":5,"human":"2006-Mar-23","y":2006,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dn5gsup7prgy49russqz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dn5gsup7prgy49russqz","width":194,"height":259}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gombjmbhznoaibvnsaib.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gombjmbhznoaibvnsaib","width":840,"height":1200},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibara_(video_game)"}]},{"id":44624,"name":"Tarzan: Untamed","slug":"tarzan-untamed","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tarzan-untamed","created_at":1499430890289,"updated_at":1516159204317,"summary":"Tarzan's peaceful jungle world falls prey to a mad Victorian scientist and vicious poachers in this gripping sequel tale to Disney's Tarzan animated film.

However, this contract only covers the use of the NCAA name and related logos, not those of individual schools and conferences, which are negotiated individually or through the Collegiate Licensing Company. The CLC concurrently announced that it would extend its existing licensing deal with EA through 2017, ensuring that EA Sports could continue the series without the NCAA branding.[1] However, the series was placed on hiatus in September 2013, following three major conferences pulling their trademark licenses from EA, and uncertainties surrounding the results of lawsuits involving the use of player likenesses in-game.

It was also released on the Sega Saturn. \n \nThis compilation includes the classic games: \n \n- Konami's Tennis (1984): \nReleased in 1984, Konami's Tennis plays much like Atari's Realsports Tennis but with ladies instead of men. The game can be played by one player against the CPU, two player singles or two player doubles. A referee in the tower tells whether the ball is in or not. Serving and shooting is a simple matter of timing against the 3D animated ball, and you need not worry whether it is to the left or right of your player. Certain features uncommon at the time, such as net balls and a ball fetching boy, are also supported. \n \n- Konami's Soccer (1985): \nSoccer is an action game for two players or one player against the computer. You can play the game in one of five skill levels, choose from several different teams, and select the amount of time the match will take. Soccer features throw-ins, goal kicks, corner kicks, penalty kicks and an overhead view of the field which scrolls to follow the action. \n \n- Konami Rally (1985): \nA basic racing game in which you have to finish within the time limit and reach the finish with a given ranking. You 'll start as the last driver in the field and you will have to fight your way forward by over taking your competitors. The number of cars you 'll have to pass will increase each stage. The car has two gears, low and high and tends to slip in curves. \n \n- Comic Bakery (1984): \nA baker tries to bake and deliver bread while fighting raccoons. Pieces of bread are moving along a factory line. The raccoons try to eat your bread and also try to switch off your machines. You have to keep your machinery running and also scaring away the raccoons. If you do that your delivery truck will be loaded with bread and drive off. \n \n- Pippols (1985): \nA young farmer go in search of the pipul, the sacred tree of Buddah, to get the jewel that is hidden inside of it (a rare flower) and take it back to his home. \n \n- King's Valley (1985): \nKing's Valley is a puzzle game in which you need to collect all the treasures by drilling and cutting your way through the pyramids. But beware of the mummies that haunt the pyramids. If you use the limited available cutting and drilling equipment in the wrong order you'll eventually get stuck. You'll then have to play the whole level over again. \n \n- Penguin Adventure (1986): \nPenguin Adventure: the main character - a male penguin - must save the penguin princess from a sickness that has spread across the penguin world. The cure to the sickness can be found in the Golden Apple of the Golden Apple Tree. In this action packed game, you take control of the male penguin and travel across the lands and seas in search of the Golden Apple, fighting different types of enemies including bats, thunder-striking clouds, and environmental obstacles such as rocks, until finally reaching the princess. The stages feature different types of landscapes such as forests, mountains, caves, and water stages. As you fight your way through, you can also catch flying fish which you can trade at the different types of shops for new equipments and a weapon. \n \n- Time Pilot (1983): \nTime Pilot is an arcade style shooter. Piloting your trusty spaceship, you need to destroy the squadrons of enemy craft that are attacking! On each level you have a quota of enemies that need to be destroyed. After fulfilling your quota, a final boss of the level will appear; when destroyed, you will move on to the next level. The game begins in the year 1910, and each time a level is completed you advance in time. In 1910 you only have to face relatively unarmed biplanes, but as the levels advance so does the technology. Each new level brings with it tougher, more heavily armed aircraft including jets, helicopters, and even flying saucers! From time to time, you will encounter a parachute; if you run into this, you will earn bonus points. \n \n- Parodius (1987): \nThis is mostly the parody of Gradius (Nemesis on some systems), with some flavor from other shoot-em-ups, like Twinbee. The series is available on numerous platforms. The game is a right-to-left scrolling shoot-em-up. You can choose from 4 different flying creatures, with different weapons. You must finish 7 stages, each having a boss at the end. You may start at either one, but must complete every level to advance to the final stage. \n \n- Salamander (1987): \nIn a distant part of the universe, an alien creature called Zelos was born. As he grew so did his appetite, and soon he began devouring galaxies, planets, and stars by the hundreds. Now your planet has appeared in Zelos' path, and it is up to you and a partner to fly into battle to save your world. Life Force is an action packed shooter based on the arcade game. There are six levels which alternate between side and vertical scrolling, each of them ending with a powerful guardian. Throughout the game, destroying certain enemies will release power ups which can be used to equip your ship with more powerful weapons, extra speed, and shields. Gameplay is for one player or two players simultaneously.","collection":3804,"popularity":1.0,"games":[28856,22690,55752,68324,10039,1070,47823,36926,12632,72179],"tags":[1,268435464,268435466,268435470,536871208,536871872,536872078,536875069],"category":0,"keywords":[296,960,1166,4157],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,10,14],"first_release_date":892944000000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":892944000000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Apr-19","y":1998,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gotp42ddva0v1supmlj1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gotp42ddva0v1supmlj1","width":610,"height":613}},{"id":44778,"name":"Hajime no Ippo - The Fighting!","slug":"hajime-no-ippo-the-fighting","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hajime-no-ippo-the-fighting","created_at":1499436367562,"updated_at":1516698687029,"summary":"This game is based on the boxing Manga and Anime series \"Hajime no Ippo\" created by Jyoji \"George\" Morikawa.

It also houses a \"Stage Clear\" mode in which you have to face either 10, 20, or 30 opponents, as well as two multiplayer modes which can be played with either other players or AI substitutes. \n \nFor the Quest mode itself, it allowed the player to customize the armory in ways in which made Arle stronger with a double-edged sword effect. You could remove the Puyo Rings in order to beef up her attack at the expense of being unable to see your next pieces for example, and the amount of experience gained and gold won was relative to how big a chain was scored and how quickly the opponent was defeated. \n \nThe key point in the Puyo Puyo gameplay of Box is that the player can choose a ruleset from either \"Puyo Puyo\", \"Puyo Puyo 2\", \"Puyo Puyo Sun\" and \"Puyo Puyo~n\". This can effectively lead to 4-player battles where each player plays with independent or mixed rules. This game also allowed for team battles to take place. A special multiplayer mode was made available in this game, known as \"Treasure Mode\", which was adapted in \"Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary\" as its \"Excavation Mode\".","collection":3350,"popularity":1.0,"games":[25222,25646,60044,8197,26223,69551,14047,56292,34919,37094],"tags":[1,268435465,536871872,536873787,536875284,536875379,536876763,536879119],"category":0,"keywords":[960,2875,4372,4467,5851,8207],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":980035200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":980035200000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jan-21","y":2001,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Puyo Pop Box","comment":"Other"}]},{"id":44781,"name":"Puyo Puyo Sun - Ketteiban","slug":"puyo-puyo-sun-ketteiban","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puyo-puyo-sun-ketteiban","created_at":1499436374625,"updated_at":1500536131731,"summary":"This game is a Japan-only port of the third game in the Puyo Puyo series originally made for the Arcades by Sega. \n \nThe name of Puyo Puyo Sun comes from a Japanese pun on \"san\", and also indicates a new Ojama brought into the game.

This created a semi-resort, in which characters have decided to visit. Arle, together with Carbuncle, find the sun too hot, and see the building that Satan's emanating his own heat wave.

It was released only in Japan and was also the only one in the series not to feature a Pac-Man game. \nThe limited edition comes in a large box designed to hold all 6 Namco Museum releases as well as a memory card. \n \nIt features 7 titles: \n \n- Dragon Saber (1990): A vertical scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1990. It is the sequel to Dragon Spirit, released 3 years earlier. \nSTORY: The human beings have repeated their own foolish history, because of their own desires. And everything around then has amounted to come to nothing. Advanced alchemy has caused environmental disruption. The world has been filled with evil creatures. And the human beings have threatened with extinction. Meanwhile, the sun god, Amaterasu appeared from the sky to human, and told. \"The brave young man Huey and Siria. I grant you this sacred saber.\" \"Show your good spirit!\" \n \n- Wonder Momo (1987): A beat 'em up arcade game that was released exclusively in Japan by Namco in 1987. It runs on Namco System 86 hardware, and was later ported to the PC-Engine in 1989. It is Namco's last 8-bit arcade game. This game was never released outside of Japan, probably because of its slightly questionable content. Momo is a young girl who gets super-powers, hence becoming Wonder Momo and battling costumed villains. \n \n- Rompers (1989): an arcade game that was released by Namco in 1989 only in Japan. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware. \nYou control a guy wearing a straw hat named Chap who must collect all of the keys in 61 maze-like gardens while avoiding various enemies to rescue his girlfriend, Rumina. He can push the walls over to crush the enemies, but they will come back as eggs which will hatch after a few seconds. There is also a strict time limit to ensure you don't dawdle. \n \n- Motos (1985): An arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy. It has 62 levels. \nThe player must maneuver a bumper car to bump enemies off the edge of the playfield while they attempt to do the same to it. Power-ups give the car extra bumping power and the ability to jump over gaps in the playfield. \n \n- Sky Kid (1985): A horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow 2 players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and this version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service in North America on May 19, 2008 at a cost of 500 Wii Points. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions. \nThe players play as the Sky Kids \"Red Baron\" and \"Blue Max\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le Mérite, informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. \n \n- King \u0026 Balloon (1980): A fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1980. It runs on Namco Galaxian hardware but with an extra Z80 processor to drive a DAC for speech; the King speaks when he is captured (\"HELP!\"), when he is rescued (\"Thank you\"), and when he is carried away (\"BYE BYE!\"). Additionally, the balloons make the same \"droning\" sound as the ships in Galaxian, which was released the previous year. The player's shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game. \nThe player controls two green men (likely soldiers in the king's army) with an orange cannon that fires at squads of descending balloons. You must protect the king and prevent him from being captured and carried away by one of the balloons. \n \n- Rolling Thunder (1986): A run and gun arcade game that was released by Namco in 1986. It runs on the Namco System 86 hardware platform and was licensed for US distribution to Atari Games. Set in the 1960s, the player takes the role of a secret agent who must save his female partner from a terrorist organization. \nThe player takes control of Albatross, a member of Interpol's \"Rolling Thunder\" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York. \nAlbatross must travel through two different segments or \"stories\", each comprised of five stages, for a total of ten stages.","collection":1323,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[78759,22529,77431,77428,69883,47570,5162,80871,80870,80862],"tags":[536871872,536875093],"category":3,"keywords":[960,4181],"first_release_date":880848000000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":880848000000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Nov-30","y":1997,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rhfo9kscsrrlnfwshas3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rhfo9kscsrrlnfwshas3","width":300,"height":300},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco_Museum"}]},{"id":44786,"name":"Namco Anthology Vol. 2","slug":"namco-anthology-vol-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/namco-anthology-vol-2","created_at":1499436404729,"updated_at":1513074716412,"summary":"This is the second volume of one of the series of Namco game compilations, released only in Japan.

To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel.

By repeatedly shooting bells that come out of the clouds, these bells will change colors, each color giving a different ability. Getting shot down releases a ghost of Stinger, which can be recollected to gain the jet's powers back. In the two-player mode, Twinbee (cyan craft) and Winbee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join \"hand-to-hand\" and fire a super blast.

You take on the role of Dark Schneider, an evil wizard who parts on a quest to regain back his memory. The gameplay isn’t really deep, you just go from one boss to another. You have tons of magic moves to use in battle and you can even combine them to create devastating spells. One major disadvantage is that the game was only aimed at the readers of the manga, so if you haven’t read the manga, you won’t understand anything of the characters and the background story. \n \nBastard? Destructive God of Darkness is a manga by Kazushi Hagiwara. It first appeared in Weekly Shonen Jump, in 1988, and continues to be published irregularly today in Ultra Jump. Currently, it spans 25 volumes. \n \nIn Bastard?, the Kingdom of Meta-Rikana is attacked by four armies. This prompts Dark Schneider, a wizard, to awaken within the body of 14-year old Lucian Lenren. \n \nBastard?'s history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons \u0026 Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are endless rulers, each one with his own army of knights and mages, who fight for survival against those beasts and the armies of multiple evil sorcerers. \n \nIn the anime, the six episodes tell of the awakening of Dark Schneider (also called Darsh or Darshu by those who know him well) and his subsequent attempts to destroy his old allies (The Four Lords of Havoc) and take over the world, whilst winning over multiple love interests. Dark Schneider had been imprisoned fifteen years earlier, trapped inside the body of Yoko's friend Lucien following a failed attempt to take over the world. In the meantime, his four generals attempted to resurrect the god Anthrasax, who would bring about an apocalypse and create the Sorcerer's Kingdom from the ashes of the old world. \n \nThe story takes place in the future, a post-apocalyptic time following the release of Anthrasax at the height of Modern Civilization. Technology is gone and magic has asserted itself as a force in the world. Shortly after the fall of the modern world, demonic creatures began to appear en masse and forced humans to revert to a feudalistic, city-state based society. The episodes are rather disjointed, with scenes missing in between episodes making it hard to follow, but taken at face value it makes enough sense. \n \nManufacturer's description: \n \nHagiwara Hazime solstitial popular comic \"BASTARD!!\" based on an original story developed in RPG. And the battle system with a highly strategic position is reflected in the war situation and the compatibility of the character. Dark Schneider is working with the hero lost memory, to return to the real world back memories, let our adventure with friends. \n \nFeatures: \nFirst person perspective \n2D \u0026 3D graphics \nCartoon graphics \nSCI-FI, Futuristic, Magic \u0026 Anime themes. \n \nBASIC CONTROLS: \nMove character / Move between actions - D-Pad \nSelect action - Circle Button \nRun - Square Button \nLook down / Cancel action - X Button \nLook up - Triangle Button \nSide step left - L1 Button \nSide step right - R1 Button \nSave menu - Select Button \nMenu - Start Button","collection":4266,"popularity":1.0,"games":[12632,26766,36926,18398,36534,19698,64061,68393,47823,55092],"tags":[268435468,536871208,536871938,536875053,536875054],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,4141,4142],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":854409600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":854409600000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Jan-28","y":1997,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rshcnqeqnlpppxsbcuxl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rshcnqeqnlpppxsbcuxl","width":640,"height":647}},{"id":44807,"name":"Nekketsu Oyako: Hot Blooded Family","slug":"nekketsu-oyako-hot-blooded-family","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nekketsu-oyako-hot-blooded-family","created_at":1499436591887,"updated_at":1500536146768,"summary":"Middle-aged housewife Saeko Hibino has a secret: she's actually a Nobel laureate theoretical physicist who devised a completely new type of antimatter fusion reactor at only 17 years old.

One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another \"child\" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard... \n \nLangrisser V features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The \"Judgment System\" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their \"judgment level\". Like in Langrisser III, there is an element of \"love simulation\" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":920160000000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":920160000000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Feb-28","y":1999,"m":2}]},{"id":44863,"name":"Gungage","slug":"gungage","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gungage","created_at":1499442587337,"updated_at":1515739146697,"summary":"Gungage is a futuristic Third Person Shooter for the PlayStation.

It was also released on the Sega Saturn. \n \nThis compilation includes the classic games: \n \n- Konami's Boxing (1984): \nA boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option. \n \n- Konami's Ping-Pong (1985): \nFrom Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the winning margin. \n \n- Hyper Sports 2 (1985): \nThree tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full sequence of events is - skeet shooting, archery and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one. \n \n- Mopiranger (1985): \nThe peaceful land of the Mopira have been invaded by the Razons. In this platform game you 'll play Mopiranger and you have to save the young Moplits, who have been kidnapped by the dastardly Razons. The levels are build in a maze-like pattern in which you have to find and rescue the young Moplits from the hostile Razons. Using the obstacles present in the game you can block the Razons, but also lock yourself in... \n \n- Antarctic Adventure (1984): \nAs a penguin, you must travel around Antarctica, making your way between bases before time runs out. This sounds easy, right? Wrong. Hindering your progress will be ice crevices and leopard seals. You can jump over the crevices, but jumping over the leopard seals may be difficult. You can speed up or slow down the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France, New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish for points. Collecting a flashing flag will allow you to wear a propeller that enable you to fly over those hazards. \n \n- Yie Ar Kung-Fu (1984): \nBased on the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows Oolong's quest to become a Kung-Fu master. Of course this involves fighting a wide range of opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well armed with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong's task won't be easy. \n \n- Road Fighter (1985): \nA top view racing game. You have to reach the finish line before time runs out. Don't crash into the wall, cars or trucks. Because if you do you will lose gasoline. You can get additional gasoline by picking up fuel items. Especially avoid the purple cars, they do change lanes! And remember... oil makes road slippery... \n \n- Sky Jaguar (1984): \nVertical shooter. When a weakened and vulnerable Earth is invaded by the vicious Zephyr army, the planet's only hope is a fleet of powerful ships, the Sky Jaguars. It 'll take sharp reflexes and amazing skills to survive the Zephyrians' unrelenting assault... can you last long enough to discover and destroy the enemy's hidden headquarters? \n \n- Gradius (1986): \nThe people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an all out attack against the planet, and it's up to you to fly into battle and save them. Along the way you'll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed, force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle. Based on the arcade game, Gradius is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. \n \n- Gofer no Yabou: Episode 2 (1988): \nAlso known as Nemesis 3 - The Eye Of Destruction. Gradius 3 is a vertical scrolling shoot 'm up.

Once the boss is defeated, Zan gets the chance to unleash as much punishment on his foe in 30 seconds as he can; higher damage values will change the finishing move he uses to slay his foe.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[536,12571,37030,7202,6045,12597,28302,1103,11118,6707],"tags":[1,536870921,536871041,536871165,536871776,536873362,536873507,536873591,536874398,536874743,536875095,536875099,536875125,536875199,536875228,536875262,536875330,536875331,536875342,536875358,536875362,536875437,536875449,536875452,536875511,536875523,536875526,536875532,536875792,536875822,536876122,536876128,536876191,536876242,536876261,536876281,536876355,536876901,536877373,536878217,536878460,536884031,536884863],"category":0,"keywords":[9,129,253,864,2450,2595,2679,3486,3831,4183,4187,4213,4287,4316,4350,4418,4419,4430,4446,4450,4525,4537,4540,4599,4611,4614,4620,4880,4910,5210,5216,5279,5330,5349,5369,5443,5989,6461,7305,7548,13119,13951],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":941241600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":941241600000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Oct-30","y":1999,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fjw15qys0qexvniw7qjx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fjw15qys0qexvniw7qjx","width":1000,"height":1024},"esrb":{"rating":6}},{"id":44977,"name":"Rescue Copter","slug":"rescue-copter","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rescue-copter","created_at":1499444382207,"updated_at":1516687362811,"summary":"The company behind the Jet Copter and Jet Stream series in Japan, AquaSystem, flies its Rescue Copter across the Pacific for this stateside PlayStation release.

The next step is to create a music video for your masterpiece, and you'll have plenty of 3D clips at your disposal in so doing. Once you have your complete package, you can save everything to a memory card and access any part of it (from an instrument sound or keyboard riff to the entire song) later. All in all, it's about the most creative use of a video game console imaginable.","collection":4385,"popularity":1.0,"games":[44242,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,55590,55689,22406,23867],"tags":[268435463,268435465,268435469,536872060,536874136,536875049,536875751,536876694,536876973,536878239,536880048,536880491,536882865,536884863],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,3224,4137,4839,5782,6061,7327,9136,9579,11953,13951],"genres":[7,9,13],"first_release_date":946512000000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":946512000000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Dec-30","y":1999,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Music 2000","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dfaslqils8rmbkmr2tqt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dfaslqils8rmbkmr2tqt","width":280,"height":280},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":45099,"name":"NASCAR 2001","slug":"nascar-2001","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nascar-2001","created_at":1499448654324,"updated_at":1515678002530,"summary":"Authentic Nascar Racing: The real drivers, cars, teams, tracks, sponsers, and rules. \n \nTop Drivers: Over 30 drivers including Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt, Tony Stewart, Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte, Mark Martin, Dale Earnhardt Jr and Bobby Hamilton. \n \nMore Tracks: Daytona and 13 other Nascar tracks with both day and night racing. \n \nFull or \"Track Pack\" Season: Race a full or half Nascar season or choose to compete on track packs: race just on short tracks, road courses, speedways or superspeedways.","collection":3297,"popularity":1.0,"games":[22425,40470,54789,54662,44242,18623,5946,22470,29173,26145],"tags":[268435466,268435469,268435470,536872060,536872078,536875069,536875140,536875271,536875562,536875955,536876786,536876973,536881348],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,1166,4157,4228,4359,4650,5043,5874,6061,10436],"genres":[10,13,14],"first_release_date":971913600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":971913600000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Oct-19","y":2000,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dllbfdfihgrdp0naigdr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dllbfdfihgrdp0naigdr","width":416,"height":489},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":45100,"name":"Motocross Mania 2","slug":"motocross-mania-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/motocross-mania-2","created_at":1499448656777,"updated_at":1500536454065,"summary":"Motocross Mania 2 brings the reckless action of motocross racing back to the PlayStation.

The game was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. It released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in October 2010. \n \nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the area of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The player takes control of the character known as Courier 6, who, preceding the start of the game, is hired by a delivery service called the Mojave Express to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to the New Vegas Strip. The game starts during the delivery, where the Courier is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. By doing this, the player becomes caught between various factions competing for control over the desert and its most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam, ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants. \n \nEven though it directly succeeds Fallout 3 in order of Fallout game releases, offers a similar action role-playing experience, and shares its engine and legacy content with Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a direct sequel. It marks the return of some elements found in Fallout 2. The game was a critical and commercial success, shipping more than 5 million copies altogether.

It was released on 29 April 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and on 2 December 2008 on Microsoft Windows. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Set within the fictional Liberty City (based on New York City), the single-player story follows a war veteran, Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands. \n \nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.[c] Two expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists. \n \nDevelopment began in 2004, soon after the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. Following its announcement in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated.[4] Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at the game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and ability to drive under the influence of alcohol. Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1290729600000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1290729600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Nov-26","y":2010,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gark8ke4gxupotti2pbv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gark8ke4gxupotti2pbv","width":1295,"height":1291}},{"id":45133,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD Bundled Limited Edition","slug":"the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd-bundled-limited-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd-bundled-limited-edition","created_at":1499454535322,"updated_at":1523739838040,"summary":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD Limited Edition was bundled with the Wii U console.","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":1033,"version_title":"HD Bundled Limited Edition","category":0,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xv0ncrvv4cczecv7cbbv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xv0ncrvv4cczecv7cbbv","width":1500,"height":1500}},{"id":45134,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD - Limited Edition","slug":"the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-limited-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-limited-edition","created_at":1499454540810,"updated_at":1523739740814,"hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":1036,"version_title":"HD Limited Edition","category":0,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m5qgtm2nayzpnk295krk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m5qgtm2nayzpnk295krk","width":295,"height":300}},{"id":45135,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD Limited Edition","slug":"the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd-limited-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd-limited-edition","created_at":1499454543298,"updated_at":1523739838530,"summary":"This edition included a Ganondorf figurine.","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":2276,"version_title":"HD Limited Edition","category":0,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/al2mt1bc1oan6avdfti9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"al2mt1bc1oan6avdfti9","width":1228,"height":1400}},{"id":45136,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword Collector's Edition","slug":"the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-collectors-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-collectors-edition","created_at":1499454545209,"updated_at":1523738943665,"hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":534,"version_title":"Collector's Edition","category":0,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nerfsnfbprnmvmhz8bzf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nerfsnfbprnmvmhz8bzf","width":448,"height":505}},{"id":45137,"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Master Edition","slug":"the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-master-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-master-edition","created_at":1499454547322,"updated_at":1523658293750,"summary":"Woken from a 100-year slumber, Link must explore the wilds to regain his lost memories and save Hyrule.

Designed for the Triforce arcade board (also used for F-Zero AX), players can race as one of eleven characters on twenty-four tracks. On certain machines, for an additional fee, a player's data can be saved on a magnetic card which can be inserted into the machine again later to retain unlocked items and records. Nintendo's limited role of development was mainly isolated to ensuring that it was a worthy title for the established franchise. \n \nThis game's arcade cabinet houses a camera that will take a photograph of the player's face. The photo can be customized and then will be displayed above the player's character during multiplayer races. \n \nThe game is noted for being the first Mario Kart to feature playable crossover characters: Namco's Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man and Blinky. The game's sequel also featured Mametchi, a character from the Tamagotchi games.

Riding the trails is the bulk of the gameplay. The player can race their horse against several of Barbie's friends. There are also some mini-games that the player comes across while riding. The mini-games involve activities such as arranging flowers in their proper sequence, sorting apples, and frog-hopping.","collection":1312,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[44242,54662,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,55590,55689,22406],"tags":[268435469,268435470,536871535,536872060,536872078,536875054,536875057,536875096,536875395,536875725],"category":0,"keywords":[623,1148,1166,4142,4145,4184,4483,4813],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":886291200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":886291200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Feb-01","y":1998,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sycixuh7k31sickfe3pp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sycixuh7k31sickfe3pp","width":425,"height":500}},{"id":45165,"name":"Barbie: Magic Hair Styler","slug":"barbie-magic-hair-styler","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-magic-hair-styler","created_at":1499455691028,"updated_at":1513023777082,"summary":"Choose either Barbie, Kira, Christie or Teresa and style her just the way you want. \n \nCustomize her hair (cut, grow, curl or brush), her make-up (eyeshadow, lipstick, blush or even fun fake tatoos) and choose her clothes and accessories, all according to the party she'll be attending to tonight. \n \nOnce you're done styling, watch your chosen model showing off her outfit in 3D, and you can even take pictures, frame them and print them.","collection":1312,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28465,44242,34919,33603,36962,55888,65827,43130,24436,28277],"tags":[34,268435469,536871446,536875395,536875725],"category":0,"keywords":[534,4483,4813],"themes":[34],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":854755200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":854755200000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Feb-01","y":1997,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vlhqe6svefkbocu1bxwm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlhqe6svefkbocu1bxwm","width":480,"height":480}},{"id":45166,"name":"Barbie: Fashion Designer","slug":"barbie-fashion-designer","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-fashion-designer","created_at":1499455696115,"updated_at":1513070875757,"collection":1312,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[78256,28465,23781,69051,45165,3307,34919,44242,78527,8081],"tags":[34,268435469,536871446,536873064,536875054,536875057,536875395,536875725,536876694,536877386],"category":0,"keywords":[534,2152,4142,4145,4483,4813,5782,6474],"themes":[34],"genres":[13],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vggwbbhiyxa0pwlxsvu8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vggwbbhiyxa0pwlxsvu8","width":200,"height":270}},{"id":45167,"name":"Barbie: Magic Genie Adventure","slug":"barbie-magic-genie-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-magic-genie-adventure","created_at":1499455698590,"updated_at":1515845055549,"summary":"Barbie: Magic Genie Adventure is an Action game, developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Mattel, which was released in 2000.","collection":1312,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23175,59516,55289,25646,37022,25311,19448,28380,47823,37088],"tags":[1,268435487,536875054,536875057,536875395,536875725,536878439],"category":0,"keywords":[4142,4145,4483,4813,7527],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":976492800000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":976492800000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Dec-11","y":2000,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rs9wxonoav0pw0ignjxw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rs9wxonoav0pw0ignjxw","width":461,"height":500},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":45168,"name":"Barbie: Fashion Pack Games","slug":"barbie-fashion-pack-games","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-fashion-pack-games","created_at":1499455700610,"updated_at":1515853517719,"summary":"Barbie: Fashion Pack Games is an Action game, developed by Hyperspace Cowgirls and published by Mattel, which was released in 2000.","collection":1312,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[34919,36608,16468,19448,45173,45167,23175,51464,28380,59516],"tags":[1,536873064,536875054,536875057,536875395,536875725],"category":0,"keywords":[2152,4142,4145,4483,4813],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":970358400000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":970358400000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Oct-01","y":2000,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n2rd5vq0yncc7rtq6yhz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n2rd5vq0yncc7rtq6yhz","width":300,"height":300},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":45169,"name":"Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper","slug":"barbie-the-princess-and-the-pauper","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/barbie-the-princess-and-the-pauper","created_at":1499455702534,"updated_at":1500370039941,"summary":"Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper is based on Barbie's home video take on the favorite fable.

The game features characters from both the Street Fighter franchise and Namco's Tekken series. In the game, players select two characters and face other duos in tag team fighting matches, in which the objective is to knock out one of the members from the opposing team. In addition to the game's multiplayer modes, the game also features a single-player Story mode with a plot revolving around a mysterious object called the \"Pandora\". \n \nThe game is the product of a partnership between Namco and Capcom that previously produced the role-playing game Namco × Capcom. As Street Fighter X Tekken was made by Capcom, with Namco being involved more in the licensing of the Tekken cast, the gameplay is based on the 2D gameplay of Street Fighter, with projectile moves such as the Hadouken, as opposed to the Tekken series. Namco is currently producing their own take on the crossover, Tekken X Street Fighter, which will follow their 3D style of gameplay. Unique features in Street Fighter X Tekken include the Gem System, which allows players to equip special gems to power-up various character attributes and Pandora Mode, in which a character's strength and abilities are temporarily augmented. \n \nThe game was well received by critics, who complimented the roster and deep game mechanics. Nevertheless, it fell short of Capcom's sales expectations. In addition, Capcom's release of downloadable content (DLC) for the game was met with criticism when it was revealed that the company was charging for access to characters that were already on the game disc.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1333670400000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1333670400000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Apr-06","y":2012,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qxhxep1ugqqgwiyvebqe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qxhxep1ugqqgwiyvebqe","width":1500,"height":2135}},{"id":45198,"name":"Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition","slug":"hyper-street-fighter-ii-the-anniversary-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hyper-street-fighter-ii-the-anniversary-edition","created_at":1499456453429,"updated_at":1515641793598,"summary":"Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition is a competitive fighting game by Capcom that was originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2003 in Japan and in 2004 in North America and Asia.

Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Butterfinger, similar to real-life sponsored racing.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,95640,95127,93853,91243,89117,88998,88522,87741],"tags":[268435466,268435470],"category":0,"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":877046400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":877046400000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Oct-17","y":1997,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kualqmspml4wehjjmssv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kualqmspml4wehjjmssv","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fghacg2qqtemsvasqrhu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fghacg2qqtemsvasqrhu","width":1024,"height":768}]},{"id":45215,"name":"NFL Game Day 2005","slug":"nfl-game-day-2005","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nfl-game-day-2005","created_at":1499457688621,"updated_at":1515735500639,"summary":"NFL GameDay 2005[edit] \nNFL GameDay 2005 was the tenth and final game in the NFL GameDay series, and unlike the last few GameDay video games, it was only available on the PlayStation console, and not on the PlayStation 2.

After the wholesale demolition of his jungle fortress, Crax went into hiding, Under the bizarre alias of Quentin Bloodfinger he created Crax Industries as a front organization for his flourishing narcotics empire. Bloodfinger himself moved into the top floor penthouse suite of his recently constructed thirty floor high rise The Crax Plaza. Soon after the completion of the building Crax had his happy band of Libyan electricians install a myriad of electronic counter measures and state of the art security systems. The ground floor was fortified and most of the upper level windows replaced with two meters of reinforced concrete.","collection":1618,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,32902,10039,68287,68142,28751,24920,272],"tags":[1,268435461,536872983],"category":0,"keywords":[2071],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":602294400000,"platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":26,"date":602294400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Feb-01","y":1989,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Joe Blade 3","comment":"Other"}]},{"id":45243,"name":"Joe Blade II","slug":"joe-blade-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/joe-blade-ii","created_at":1499458390494,"updated_at":1512987959228,"collection":1618,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28751,1070,25646,10039,37094,1073,51485,26848,1188,19289],"tags":[1,268435464,268435465,536870913,536875171,1073741828],"publishers":[11593,9474],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,4259],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,9],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[63,134,93,69,13,65,16,15,26,25,94],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":134,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":94,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":93,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":69,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Joe Blade 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u0riwrt4jveuxnue1yni.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u0riwrt4jveuxnue1yni","width":1000,"height":1568}},{"id":45244,"name":"Motorbike Madness","slug":"motorbike-madness","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/motorbike-madness","created_at":1499458394398,"updated_at":1515594388325,"summary":"Motorbike Madness views downhill racing from an isometric Marble Madness-influenced perspective.

The first-person action plays out in dystopian outpost environments on the original game's planet of Pandora, five years later, as a greedy industrialist called Handsome Jack seeks to weed out the local populace through a series of gladiator matches. Players choose from four new character types, each with three branches of specialized development in the game's RPG-like experience system. Experience comes with kills and quest completions. \n \nExpanding on the original game, Borderlands 2's gun system can create millions of different computer-generated weapons, as well as shields and equipment enhancements.

There are also Ten-Dart century (score exactly 100 with 10 darts), Shanghai (where only darts thrown at a particular area can score) and Scram (where one player shoots to successively knock sectors out of play, and the opponent must score as much as possible from the others).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,72162,54662,15851,81281,80876,80865,80456,80412,79667],"tags":[268435470,536872078,536876457],"category":0,"keywords":[1166,5545],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":26,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jmdyqyhbnjefvcpxgvdu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jmdyqyhbnjefvcpxgvdu","width":500,"height":400}},{"id":45353,"name":"Planetoids","slug":"planetoids","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/planetoids","created_at":1499504795287,"updated_at":1500536532733,"summary":"GAMEPLAY : Just like ASTEROIDS - shoot the asteroids and the \noccasional alien ship. \n \nCOMMENTS : \"A very good copy and a classic clone with the best \ngraphics of the lot.\" (CRASH #1, February 1984)","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5]},{"id":45354,"name":"Adventure B Inca Curse","slug":"adventure-b-inca-curse","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/adventure-b-inca-curse","created_at":1499504796825,"updated_at":1513004037798,"summary":"Released in 1982, Adventure B: Inca Curse is the second in a series of eight \ninteractive fiction adventures made by Artic Computing.

A sequel followed in 1997, the winter sports based Winter Heat. \n \nThe game play is largely based on quick repeated button pressing for gaining speed, and timed single button presses for jumping and releasing projectiles, in a similar style to the 1983 Konami release, Track \u0026 Field. The game differed with a slightly more advanced control system and 3-D graphics. \n \nThe player must select one of eight international fictitious athletes.

Each match is made up of two teams that can include one fighter or multiple fighters that can be switched out at various times.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75962,46815,75964,75858,75857,75853,68609,55058,50726,50704],"tags":[268435460],"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":836179200000,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":836179200000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Jul-01","y":1996,"m":7}]},{"id":45390,"name":"Blazing Heroes","slug":"blazing-heroes","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/blazing-heroes","created_at":1499506013760,"updated_at":1500509204823,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":45391,"name":"Vampire Savior","slug":"vampire-savior","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/vampire-savior","created_at":1499506016129,"updated_at":1500536587730,"summary":"Darkstalkers 3, titled in Japan as Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire (ヴァンパイア セイヴァー The Lord of Vampire Vanpaia Seivā Za Rōdo Obu Vanpaia?), is the second sequel in the Darkstalkers series of fighting games by Capcom, originally released in arcades in 1997. The game retains the character roster of Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors, omitting Donovan, Huitzil and Pyron from the lineup. Taking their place were four new characters: Jedah, Lilith, Q-Bee and B. B. Hood. It also features a secret character/mode, Shadow, where the player assumes the identity of the defeated character for the next fight (e.g. if Morrigan is defeated, the next fight the player will play as Morrigan). \n \nVampire Savior eschews the traditional round-based system in favour of what is dubbed the \"Damage Gauge System\", where battles take place during a period of one round, with each fighter having two \"life markers\" (equivalent to two life bars) by default, which diminish after one character runs out of vitality. The player can also regain a portion of their life during battle if they manage to avoid taking further hits. The game also introduces the \"Dark Force System\" which allows players to perform special abilities unique to each character for a limited period.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":863740800000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":863740800000,"region":8,"human":"1997-May-16","y":1997,"m":5}]},{"id":45392,"name":"Sega Ages: Out Run","slug":"sega-ages-out-run","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sega-ages-out-run","created_at":1499506022113,"updated_at":1500536588380,"summary":"OutRun is a racing game that allows the player to race across varied terrain in a readily available Ferrari, complete with a female passenger, over a series of short tracks. \n \nGameplay is viewed from just above and behind the car.

Instead, it was originally released on the japanese Super Famicom and this port is an upgraded version of that one, featuring not only improved graphics and sound from the Super Famicom game, but some altered levels and bosses, including a cheat to replace \"Tokimeki People's Dance\" with an enhanced version, \"Days Of The Dream's Memories\". Also added were several \"Omake\" stages and an unlockable Dracula-kun and Kid Dracula as a playable character. In a two-player game, both players can now choose to play simultaneously instead of just alternately in the Super Famicom game. \n \nThis game was also released on the Sony PlayStation with little differences compared to this version.","collection":2200,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76246,19341,28029,32902,24920,272,68287,10039,68142,36608],"tags":[1,268435461],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":818985600000,"platforms":[32,7,38,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1169683200000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Jan-25","y":2007,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":851040000000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Dec-20","y":1996,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":818985600000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Dec-15","y":1995,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":850435200000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Dec-13","y":1996,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Chatting Parodius Live ~forever with me~","comment":"Translated title"},{"name":"Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius ~Forever With Me~"},{"name":"実況おしゃべりパロディウス 〜フォーエバー・ウィズ・ミー〜","comment":"Japanese Sega Saturn title"},{"name":"Chatting Parodius Live","comment":"Translated title"},{"name":"実況おしゃべりパロディウス","comment":"Japanese Famicom title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ktcogckcoqxcjufiakay.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ktcogckcoqxcjufiakay","width":480,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ax5tuea1jt2jmtiex9yu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ax5tuea1jt2jmtiex9yu","width":480,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jwma8khlh1mfqxs2wh7l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jwma8khlh1mfqxs2wh7l","width":480,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cey0amwk1fi730u4kn1f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cey0amwk1fi730u4kn1f","width":314,"height":561},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jikkyō_Oshaberi_Parodius"}]},{"id":45459,"name":"Hyper Duel","slug":"hyper-duel","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hyper-duel","created_at":1499506977913,"updated_at":1516683564586,"summary":"Hyper Duel is an Action game, developed and published by TechnoSoft, which was released in Japan in 1996.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,36950,64204,142,71455,27314,27523,25300,14364],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871882,536871937],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1025],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":757296000000,"platforms":[52,32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":757296000000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Dec-31","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":851212800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Dec-22","y":1996,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/donods2w0otxxtadthxa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"donods2w0otxxtadthxa","width":2832,"height":2784},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":45460,"name":"Shining Force III: 1st Scenario","slug":"shining-force-iii-1st-scenario","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shining-force-iii-1st-scenario","created_at":1499506981986,"updated_at":1500536628329,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75813,5613,49414,25636,25311,75398,18811,36608,74929,21842],"tags":[268435468,268435471],"category":0,"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":884476800000,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":884476800000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Jan-11","y":1998,"m":1}]},{"id":45461,"name":"Dragon Force II: Kamisarishi Daichi ni","slug":"dragon-force-ii-kamisarishi-daichi-ni","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dragon-force-ii-kamisarishi-daichi-ni","created_at":1499506987284,"updated_at":1515711351912,"summary":"Set 500 years after the first game, Dragon Force II follows a slate of monarchs who must band together to defeat a new threat looming over Legendra.

Once Astal and Jerado were dealt with, Antowas went back to sleep. \nHowever, Geist was still free, and Quartilia was not restored from the changes Jerado wrought. From his prison on the moon, Astal witnessed Geist kidnap Leda again. Consumed with the need to protect her, he freed himself and returned to Quartilia. Now Astal journeys in search of Leda through a Quartilia transformed by Jerado's dark design, along with a strange bird who for some reason just won't leave him alone...","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,1188,10039,36608,74863,1066,34919,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":814752000000,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":814752000000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Oct-27","y":1995,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/keyonxzdiffrbpa3pecl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"keyonxzdiffrbpa3pecl","width":1529,"height":2156}},{"id":45496,"name":"Andretti Racing","slug":"andretti-racing","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/andretti-racing","created_at":1499508828746,"updated_at":1500536669787,"summary":"Andretti Racing is a Formula One Racing game, developed by Press Start Inc. and published by Electronic Arts, which was released in 1996.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":823132800000,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":823132800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Feb-01","y":1996,"m":2}]},{"id":45497,"name":"Actua Golf","slug":"actua-golf","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/actua-golf","created_at":1499508832021,"updated_at":1500536671214,"summary":"Actua Golf is a golf simulation with full 3D terrain and characters.

Here, the players race around a race course against the other three characters for a top position in the race. The game's single player mode is Chaos GP, where the player's goal is to win three different circuits (green, yellow and red). Each circuit is made of six different race courses that the player is taken through in succession. \n \nEach race course is composed of a circuit which needs to be completed thrice. The playable characters have rather simple controls, their basic actions being accelerating to move forward, breaking, and moving left or right on the tracks. In tight corners, the player can break while turning in a specific direction, allowing them to drift through the corners. If the player overuses this method though, the playable character starts spinning out of control.

And although you've got armored vehicles and ant-sized infantry on your side, the battle will be lost or won by your ability to jump, hover, and fly into battle while zooming in your weapons on the enemy. \nA cross between first-person shooter and strategy game, Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise From the Ashes comes from a series that originated on the Sega Saturn. This title features such enhancements as detailed 3-D mobile suits, cinematic interstitial scenes, a dramatic soundtrack, and actual sound effects from the anime TV series, Gundam Wing.","collection":3257,"franchise":820,"franchises":[820],"popularity":2.0,"games":[28552,51464,27314,28751,15536,17446,29525,11253,10039,26401],"tags":[1,268435461,536870990,536871079,536871213,536871365,536871487,536871776,536872594,536872733,536873066,536873753,536874947,536875053,536875054,536875061,536875162,536875331,536875358,536875484,536875573,536876028,536876687,536876694,536876932,536876973,536877237,536877592,536877780,536879895,536880234,536881795,536882298,1073741825],"developers":[617],"publishers":[617],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"keywords":[78,167,301,453,575,864,1682,1821,2154,2841,4035,4141,4142,4149,4250,4419,4446,4572,4661,5116,5775,5782,6020,6061,6325,6680,6868,8983,9322,10883,11386],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":959472000000,"platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":959472000000,"region":8,"human":"2000-May-28","y":2000,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story 0079:  Rise from the Ashes","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yjazkubinoh0ul1i5air.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yjazkubinoh0ul1i5air","width":256,"height":254},"esrb":{"rating":5}},{"id":45860,"name":"Nightmare Creatures II","slug":"nightmare-creatures-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nightmare-creatures-ii","created_at":1499519099625,"updated_at":1535126067186,"summary":"\"Assume the role of Herbert Wallace, an escaped test subject, on the trail of the demonic scientist, Dr. Adam Crowley.

Series mainstays Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame are joined by former enemies Mima and Yuuka Kazami for a journey reaching to the depths of the Makai. Mystic Square also marks the first appearance of Alice Margatroid as an opponent, who later stages a comeback in Perfect Cherry Blossom. \n \nAlthough limited by the PC-98 hardware, Mystic Square is the most refined of the PC-98 Touhou titles, and features gameplay quite similar to Windows Touhou games. It employs a variant of Lotus Land Story's Dream Bonus system, rewarding the player for taking risks (i.e. collecting point items from the top of the field area). Its rank system, however, is more lenient than Lotus Land Story's.","storyline":"For no apparent reason, large quantities of demons and youkai begin to travel from Makai, the world of demons, to Gensokyo, swamping the land and leaving Reimu Hakurei with a lot of extermination to do. Frustrated, Reimu tracks the source of the invasion to \"The Cave in Which the Door to Makai is Said to Be,\" which lies in the mountains behind the Hakurei Shrine. Reimu decides that it is her duty as a shrine maiden to root out the cause of this mess. Unbeknownst to her, Marisa Kirisame has learned of her plans and decides to follow along with the hope of discovering some unique powers to steal within Makai. Elsewhere, Mima, the evil spirit of the Hakurei Shrine, and Yuuka Kazami, the youkai, decide to travel to Makai as well, although they have their own reasons for doing so. \n \nWithin the cave, the heroine encounters the guardian of the gateway to Makai, Sara, and dispatches her with ease before beginning a high-speed flight through the boundary between worlds. Therein the heroine happens across a demon traveling in the opposite direction named Louise and crushes her as well. The heroine then arrives in Makai above a massive dark city, where she is confronted by Alice Margatroid, who attacks her with the help of her living dolls. After defeating her, the heroine flies away from the city and toward a grim fortress that rises up in distance. Along the way the witches Yuki and Mai appear and attempt to impede her progress, ultimately to little effect. \n \nEntering the fortress Pandæmonium, the heroine soars past fantastic crystal designs while battling through legions of enemies. At the top she is met by a strange individual named Shinki who politely informs her that the demon invasion is entirely the fault of a civilian travel agency that is arranging tours of Gensokyo and that it lies outside of her jurisdiction. Before the protagonist can inquire as to the meaning of this they are interrupted by Yumeko, who adamantly insists that Shinki retire so that she may dispose of their uninvited guest. After defeating the maid, the protagonist meets Shinki again, who now explains that she is actually the god and creator of Makai itself. She promises to look into the tourist issue, but only after severely punishing the heroine for disrupting her realm so. This final battle is extraordinarily violent and Shinki's tremendous power leaves much of Makai in flames. \n \nAt an unspecified later date, the heroine again encounters Alice Margatroid, this time in a strange wonderland. Alice now possesses a large grimoire that grants her great magical powers and challenges the heroine to a rematch. After a lengthy battle and her second defeat, Alice laments her inability to defeat the heroine before fleeing with the book.","collection":2093,"franchise":780,"franchises":[780],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23733,47823,22387,27209,18869,24426,80916,19150,22747,14760],"tags":[1,17,268435461,268435488,536870990,536871029,536871078,536871138,536871208,536871823,536872225,536873476,536874055,536874259,536874398,536875941,536876634,536879840,536879841,536881925,536881926,536881927,536883128,1073741827],"developers":[9378],"publishers":[9378],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,117,166,226,296,911,1313,2564,3143,3347,3486,5029,5722,8928,8929,11013,11014,11015,12216],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[5,32],"first_release_date":914976000000,"platforms":[149],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":149,"date":914976000000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Dec-30","y":1998,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MS","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Th05","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Touhou Kaikidan - Mystic Square","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zbx0v13zgokcyvye9olv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zbx0v13zgokcyvye9olv","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"VI4fCroJxkg"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cvqmp1xset3m8xynwylw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cvqmp1xset3m8xynwylw","width":453,"height":329},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project#PC-98_predecessor_games"},{"category":2,"url":"http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Mystic_Square"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/top.html"}]},{"id":45964,"name":"Touhou 04 Lotus Land Story","slug":"touhou-04-lotus-land-story","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/touhou-04-lotus-land-story","created_at":1499522665866,"updated_at":1535224149079,"summary":"This game features two playable characters to choose from, with two different attack types each.

The game's scoring system also marks the series' first instance of score bonuses for the elimination of bullets following the defeat of mid-bosses and bosses.","storyline":"Following the events of the previous games, youkai soon began to swarm the Hakurei Shrine, prompting Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame to seperately head for a lake in the mountains, which appears to be the source of a tremendous power surge. The two reach the gateway underneath the lake, which teleports them to a strange dream world, in which the mansion Reimaden exists, where the mastermind supposedly is. \n \nThe heroine sets off to the lake, but sees a youkai, Orange. Orange wasn't going to fight, but the heroine attacked Orange merely because she was a youkai. The heroine goes off but encounters a vampire, Kurumi. Kurumi attempts to prevent the heroine from reaching the island in the mountain lake but fails. Ironically, Kurumi is not a lake guard or anything. After Kurumi is defeated, the heroine sets off somewhere else and finds the boundary line between the dream world and the real world. However, the heroine encounters Elly, the gatekeeper of the boundary. Elly states that depending on who you're using, either a Shrine Maiden or a Magician had entered the world. Elly is battled and defeated, thus the heroine entering the dream world. After, the heroine explores the dream world, but encounters either Reimu or Marisa, depending on who you are playing as. They are surprised to see each other and then they battle. The heroine wins as usual, forcing the other to leave the dream world. The heroine heads deeper in the dream world, but encounters Yuuka, who had just woken up and is upset that someone is in her mansion at this hour. They fought and the heroine wins. However, Yuuka retreats and runs away. The heroine is forced to chase her, leading to the final stage. Yuuka appears and again and battles the heroine one last time, however Yuuka loses again. \n \nLater on, the heroine sets into another unknown dream world. While exploring the dream world, the heroine encounters Mugetsu, a Maid who claims that this dream world is hers. Mugetsu doesn't seem to know about the tremendous power surge, but still battles the heroine merely because she was bored. Mugetsu is defeated, and asks her older twin sister, Gengetsu for help. Mugetsu leaves and Gengetsu comes into the battlefield. Gengetsu doesn't know what is happening, but knows her job is to defeat the heroine. But of course, the heroine wins and the twin sisters are defeated.","collection":2093,"franchise":780,"franchises":[780],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27209,23733,22387,47823,68441,18869,55092,28010,28168,45966],"tags":[1,17,268435461,536870990,536871029,536871078,536871208,536872225,536873476,536874259,536874398,536875941,536876634,536879840,536879841,536881922,536881923,536881924,1073741827],"developers":[9378],"publishers":[9378],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,117,166,296,1313,2564,3347,3486,5029,5722,8928,8929,11010,11011,11012],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":903052800000,"platforms":[149],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":149,"date":903052800000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Aug-14","y":1998,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"LLS","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Th04","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Touhou Gensoukyou - Lotus Land Story","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cmi87haoyeckidzbtkay.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cmi87haoyeckidzbtkay","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"xNKyPkQ-_ug"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kd46yt6tsawljxgp79hk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kd46yt6tsawljxgp79hk","width":483,"height":326},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project#PC-98_predecessor_games"},{"category":2,"url":"http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Lotus_Land_Story"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/top.html"}]},{"id":45965,"name":"Touhou 03 Phantasmagoria of Dim.

There is no guarantee that any given card will be hit, and will often fail to damage a boss. \n \nThe game consists of several stages of increasing difficulty, with a boss fight occurring every five stages. To complete a stage, the player should clear all cards or defeat the boss. Reimu will lose a life whenever she is hit by an enemy projectile or the yin-yang orb. \n \nThere are two selectable paths in the game: the Hell path and the Makai path. Each route features unique stages, bosses, and endings.","storyline":"The strength of the seal that keeps demons and other evil creatures from entering Gensokyo via the Hakurei Shrine, which also serves as an entrance to the “outside world” as you and I know it – has been diminishing. Reimu decides to go in of her own volition to see whether the cause is in there, and needs beaten up. (It does.)","collection":2093,"franchise":780,"franchises":[780],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[24426,27209,23733,20329,22387,47823,68441,55173,18869,55092],"tags":[1,17,268435461,268435465,536870990,536871029,536871138,536871208,536872225,536873476,536873787,536874398,536875071,536875472,536875941,536876311,536876634,536879840,536879841,1073741826],"developers":[9378],"publishers":[9378],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,117,226,296,1313,2564,2875,3486,4159,4560,5029,5399,5722,8928,8929],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[5,9],"first_release_date":846806400000,"platforms":[149],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":149,"date":871603200000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Aug-15","y":1997,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":149,"date":846806400000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Nov-01","y":1996,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Touhou Rei'iden - The Highly Responsive to Prayers","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"HRtP","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Th01","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b4ajokxdxef5clrv4o90.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b4ajokxdxef5clrv4o90","width":1282,"height":802},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bqbub44oykyzrpr82wc3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bqbub44oykyzrpr82wc3","width":1277,"height":801}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sb3qjzxdbsnar8vvhdgt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sb3qjzxdbsnar8vvhdgt","width":400,"height":560},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project#PC-98_predecessor_games"},{"category":2,"url":"http://touhou.wikia.com/wiki/Highly_Responsive_to_Prayers"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/top.html"}]},{"id":45968,"name":"Xna","slug":"xna","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/xna","created_at":1499522682912,"updated_at":1500470697541,"summary":"Tetsu is a young warrior who has left his home country in order to serve human rulers in their battle against the dark elves.

He is for all intents and purposes the true main character of Shining Force III. His initial motivation as the story begins is to track down and kill Galm, one of, if not the, most powerful member of the Vandals, a powerful race of beings that existed over 1,000 years ago. Julian believes that Galm killed his father and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father. \n \nJulian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny. \n \nScenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 \u0026 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some \"overlap\". Eventually Julian leads a three-party coalition consisting of the armies of both Synbios and Medion, to engage in the final conflict against Bulzome, a powerful Vandal long sealed in another dimension, and the true orchestrator of the conflict.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":909100800000,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":909100800000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Oct-23","y":1998,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dqujkv9kgwqpz1kxzwnd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dqujkv9kgwqpz1kxzwnd","width":1424,"height":1397}},{"id":46062,"name":"Shining Force III: 2nd Scenario","slug":"shining-force-iii-2nd-scenario","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shining-force-iii-2nd-scenario","created_at":1499529944808,"updated_at":1513086821367,"summary":"Scenario 2, Target: Child of God, features Medion, Prince of Destonia, and youngest of three sons of Emperor Domaric.

As discovered in Scenario 1, much of this influence comes from the Bulzome sect, as well as collaborating separatist factions within both Destonia and Aspinia.

An imaginary game world, created entirely by the pencil drawings of the \"God Hand\". The characters who inhabit this world were created by the God Hand in the same way... Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitanand Tsubohachi; the four members of the \"Heroes Team\", and Daddy; who commands the mysterious enemy character army. \n \nCalled the \"Heroes and Enemies\", they are all controlled by their master, and follow their predetermined (created?) fate. Today a battle to the end unfolds... \n \nGAMEPLAY: \nRakugaki Showtime you play as a rakugaki (scribble) character, who must fight against other rakugaki characters in a square 3D arena. The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as \"pick up, aim \u0026 throw\". In Rakugaki Showtime different \"drives\" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a \"Forward Drive Throw\", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a \"Backward Drive Throw\", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage. \n \nBy performing a \"Counter\", you are able to block most items thrown at you. If your timing is off, the Item will just bounce off you and drop down. But if you \"Counter\" just before the item hits you, your character will perform a \"Donpisha Counter\" (Donpisha means to trigger immediately), which causes the item to be reflected back at the original thrower. \n \nOne of the more important items in the game is a Smiley Ball. Unlike all other items, Smiley Balls will not be destroyed after use. Instead, every impact will slowly make the Smiley Ball go from yellow to magenta, from happy to angry. After it gets very angry, a sound clip of \"halleluja\" will play and the Smiley will be engulfed in flashing white light... it has become a Super Smiley. When you pick up a Super Smiley, you will not throw it. Instead, your rakugaki will unleash their \"Super Smiley Attack\", which in most cases is devestating. Also, your fighter may be able to use different Super Smiley Attack's by applying different drives, these are called Forward Super Smileys and the Backward Drive Super Smileys. \n \nLike every other fighting game that has ever existed, you can execute Special Moves. These usually consist of very basic button commands involving the directional buttons and generally the Circle button. Some characters have a whole arsenal of Special Moves, others only have only a handful. \n \nAround the stages are \"Item Points\", these are where the God Hand will draw the Items to be used in battle. You can make your character move to these points quickly by performing a \"Homing Dash\". To do this, jump, hold the direction you want to go and then hit the jump button again. You will fly over to the point you indicated. As well as item points, you can use a \"Homing Dash\" to quickly fly over to Smiley Balls, this is EXTREMELY helpful. You are also able to \"Chain Homing Dashes\", to do this, just hold the jump button down after doing a Homing Dash, and tap the direction of another item point before you land. You can cancel Homing Dashes mid-flight by pressing the Circle Button. \n \nGAME MODES: \n- Normal Mode: In this mode, you battle enemies in set stages. The difficulty differs depending on your performance, where doing badly (i.e. losing two times in arow) nets you crappy characters (e.g. Zacko) whereas doing well rewards youwith really good characters. At first you will only be able to play as Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitan and Tsubohachi, but everytime you complete the game you will unlock another character. There are 12 stages you must battle through, ending with a final rumble against the God Hand. \n- Versus Mode: In versus mode, you can battle to other three players or computer rtvals. \n- Training Mode: Here you select a character to fight against a Zacko who has an absurd amount of life and hardly enough brain cells to fill a pore on the human face. This isgood to test out damage for the different moves of your character. The missions are as follows: 1) Use the Smiley Ball 2) Use Items 3) Test your skills. \n \nCHARACTERS: \n- Yukiwo: Yukiwo is the standard well-rounded protagonist. He has an above averageamount of health, at 3928 HP. His running speed is Fairly Fast, and his Homing Dash speed is pretty Average. \n- Sasami: Sasami is a very agile fighter.she's skilled in the Kung Fu Arts. Both her running and Homing Dash speeds are Fast, which will allow her to run rings against most of the opposition. She is fairly \"light-weight\" though, only having 2333 HP. She only has a couple of Special Moves, and they are all pretty weak. \n- Pitan: Pitan is a cute mischievous monk, who speaks in Kansai Ben.. He has 3001 HP, his running speed is Fast,and his Homing Dash speed is Fairly Fast. Apart from being speedy, Pitan's greatest advantage over the others are his highly useful Super Smiley Attacks. \n- Tsubohachi: Tsubohachi is Pitan's unruly drunk of a father. He is constantly referred to as \"OYAJI\", which is somewhat Japanese slang for \"My Old Man\", \"Geezer\", etc. Tsubohachi is one of the most enjoyable characters to play as. Whilst your controlling him, he won'tfollow your commands 100% correctly, which gives you the feeling of playing as a drunk. It's a brilliant touch to this character.

Ten years later, a mysterious invasion force led by an evil sorceress attacked her village and kidnapped Magh, prompting Dahna on her first battle.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[2907,10039,36794,36608,74155,34919,19658,1235,40524,75089],"tags":[1,268435460],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":695865600000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":695865600000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jan-20","y":1992,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/piklfwoido1nkrea06hs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"piklfwoido1nkrea06hs","width":1535,"height":2100}},{"id":46186,"name":"Joshua \u0026 The Battle of Jericho","slug":"joshua-and-the-battle-of-jericho","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/joshua-and-the-battle-of-jericho","created_at":1499540762496,"updated_at":1513002850129,"summary":"Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams.

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly.

Some take place in the desert or forest, others take place in cities. \n \nThe cars in this game are all actual rally cars, with manufacturers from Europe and Japan both well represented. You do not get to see very many of them at one time, however, since rally races are typically time-based events. In this game, you are not competing directly against the other cars, you simply have to have the best time through the course.
