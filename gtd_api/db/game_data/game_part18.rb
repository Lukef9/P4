Players had to skim surfaces of the planets and destroy all the bunkers therein, as well as beam up fuel cells to maintain their fuel level(s) and avoiding or destroying saucers that would also appear. The game did not do very well commercially and would only be ported to the Atari 2600 a few years later (although it has reappeared on some modern day compilations since). \n \nGravitrex is a clone of Gravitar, although with many differences, such as the addition of humans dotting the planetary landscapes that have to be rescued, and the Gravitrex Plus cart also includes two bonus games and other features as well. All games are for one player only. \n \nGameplay: \n \nThe player controls a fighter ship that begins each game in a solar system. There is a sun in the middle and several planets to choose from to enter so the player can start their mission. If the player takes too long with choosing a planet, a pair of space saucers will emerge from the reactor planet and will engage the player in a dogfight if they get close enough (although the player can just elude them by entering a planet). If the player’s ship gets destroyed or the player shoots both saucers then the player will return to the main solar system screen. \nOnce the player enters a planet by thrusting into it, they must destroy every enemy bunker on the surface and dispose of every fuel tank and human. Humans and fuel tanks can be shot (although the player will not receive any points for doing so), but a bonus is given if all humans are rescued on a level (see Scoring and Extras sections), plus fuel tanks are needed to keep up the player’s fuel level (which is indicated by a line right next to the score at the top left of the screen). Humans and fuel tanks can be teleported into the player’s ship by maneuvering their ship close and activating the teleporter/shields function. Once all bunkers have been destroyed and all humans and fuel tanks have been disposed of, a sound effect will signal that the mission is complete, and upon leaving the planet, it will self-destruct and the player will be given a bonus for that planet. \n \nThe exception to this rule is the lone reactor planet on each level, which has only one target – a reactor – deep inside it. This planet is different than all the others, as the player is given 99 time units to make their way through a brief maze, shoot the reactor, and get out before time runs out or else the player’s ship will be destroyed and the reactor will remain intact. If the player does not destroy this planet last in a level then it clears out the space saucers for the remainder of the level, since this is the planet that they emerge from. \n \nDangers include the player’s ship crashing if it runs out of fuel, plus the ship will be destroyed if shot by a bunker, space saucer or alien air interceptor (which are similar to space saucers but they appear inside a planet), if they crash into a wall, the sun, space saucer or alien air interceptor, or do not leave the reactor planet before their time runs out. If the player runs out of reserve ships then the game will end. The player’s fuel, however, is replenished mostly from a fuel tank and is fully replaced upon destroying a planet, finishing a level, or with each new ship. The player’s teleporter function also doubles as a shield to protect them from enemy fire. Also, if the player defeats all planets in a level, then that level’s sun will go nova, various bonuses are then awarded (see Extras section), and if the player defeats the third level the game will end, giving a congratulations message as well as sharing some trivia about Gravitrex from the game’s programmer John Dondzila on the screen.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1012521600000,"platforms":[70],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":70,"date":1012521600000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Feb-01","y":2002,"m":2}]},{"id":46507,"name":"Vectrace","slug":"vectrace","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/vectrace","created_at":1499630284167,"updated_at":1500624500812,"summary":"Also known as Ronen's Game Cart, Vaboom!/Vectrace is a bit of an unusual homebrew entry, due to it containing one of the very few racing games for the Vectrex (Vectrace).

Many people were stunned when a downloadable video was posted as well, showing that the fast and furious gameplay from the original did indeed seem to be possible after all. It quickly sold out of its 100 copies in less than three weeks of release[1], which came with an overlay (a bit rare for Vectrex homebrews in general), were numbered and had an embossed foil logo on its box. It also came with the Spike Goes Down game included with it as well as an unlockable bonus. \n \nThen later on that year, the unlimited edition of Protector was released, although with a different game included, being Y*A*S*I, which stands for \"Yet Another Space Invaders\", as that game was a clone of that arcade classic (hence the title of this release being Protector/Y*A*S*I this time around). Again this was a bit of a surprise within the Vectrex community, as a lot of gamers in general didn't know that the Vectrex is capable of producing raster graphics as well, which Y*A*S*I proved by looking almost exactly like it's arcade cousin, having bitmapped, rather than vector graphics (note: Spike Goes Down also had raster graphics as well, it's just that this unlimited version is more well known, especially since the ROM for Spike Goes Down has yet to be released years later). No overlay was provided this time around though. \n \nProtector/Y*A*S*I instantly became one of the \"must haves\" for the Vectrex and was originally sold on the Vectrex carts web site until that was taken over by John Dondzila, where it is still available to this day at his Classic Game Creations site.

The Alliance hastily sent a secret scientific mission to study the relics, but a massive Hierarchy offensive forced the Alliance fleets to retreat beyond Vela; the mission commander, Captain Burton, decided to go into hiding on the planet and sent back the Tobermoon, her only starship, asking for help. Though the Ur-Quan forces didn't find the Earthlings during their sweep of the system, relief never arrived. Years later, with the help of a genius child born on the planet, the colonists activated the Precursor machinery and found out that it was programmed to build a starship. Using the limited store of raw materials available in the planet, in ten years the Precursor factory built a (barely) functional ship, which could be piloted only by the now grown genius child, who alone could interact with the Precursor central computer. In the first test flight, it was discovered that the ship Burton had sent for help had been severely damaged by the Ur-Quan and was orbiting unpowered in the outer solar system: the Alliance had never known of the mission's discoveries. The colonists decided to fix the recovered ship, train new crew members for both the Precursor ship and the Tobermoon and send a mission back to Earth, eager to know how the war had ended.

It was released for Japan in 1993, and then in North America, for the Macintosh in 1994 and then for the PC in 1995. \n \nIt is a game where the player, from a first-person perspective, explores ancient Kyoto city during 10th-11th century Japan. The game lacks a clear goal, but is instead nonlinear and emphasizes open exploration, giving players the freedom to explore the city and discover many pathways, buildings, situations, stories and secrets. The game deals with historical, horror, religious and educational themes, and features karma and reincarnation gameplay mechanics. Released on CD-ROM, the dialogues in the game are fully voiced in Japanese, with English subtitles in the localized North American version. The game was not a commercial success, but was critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. \n \nThe game is set in the medieval city of Kyoto around the year 1000, during the Heian period of Japanese history. The game lacks an overall plot, but it instead presents fragmented narratives in a non-linear manner, as the player character encounters various non-player characters while wandering the city. These narratives are cross-referenced to an encyclopedia, providing background information as the narratives progress and as the player comes across various characters and locations, with various stories and related information appearing at distinct locations.[9] \n \nMany of the characters in the game are based on real-life characters from the city and their appearances in the game are often loosely based on tales from the Konjaku Monogatarishū. The game deals with religion and philosophy, particularly Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy, as well as myth and legend.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[18822,15830,23198,12198,7364,55935,3025,11296,26841,13189],"tags":[17,19,22,33,268435487,536870928,536870984,536870990,536871006,536871033,536871063,536871117,536871130,536871139,536871165,536871186,536871208,536871470,536871939,536872014,536872032,536872328,536872371,536872647,536872748,536872793,536872847,536872873,536873082,536873370,536875055,536875067,536875184,536875185,536875197,536875199,536875232,536875242,536875304,536875316,536875336,536875356,536875420,536875523,536875526,536875622,536875735,536875762,536875766,536875767,536875770,536875951,536876029,536876355,536876454,536876522,536876588,536876674,536876701,536876730,536876978,536877280,536877305,536877646,536877883,536878045,536878072,536878307,536878366,536878528,536879207,536879772,536879908,536881632,536882486,536882692],"category":0,"keywords":[16,72,78,94,121,151,205,218,227,253,274,296,558,1027,1102,1120,1416,1459,1735,1836,1881,1935,1961,2170,2458,4143,4155,4272,4273,4285,4287,4320,4330,4392,4404,4424,4444,4508,4611,4614,4710,4823,4850,4854,4855,4858,5039,5117,5443,5542,5610,5676,5762,5789,5818,6066,6368,6393,6734,6971,7133,7160,7395,7454,7616,8295,8860,8996,10720,11574,11780],"themes":[17,19,22,33],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":730944000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":730944000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Mar-01","y":1993,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v8ov4s2napz6chm7l1av.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v8ov4s2napz6chm7l1av","width":306,"height":360}},{"id":46578,"name":"Legends","slug":"legends","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/legends","created_at":1499634770499,"updated_at":1515699342469,"summary":"The Earth was made as an experiment of aliens, for scientific research and cheap entertainment value.

The five playable factions are: Iron Guard, a team of human mercenaries led by former Tournament champion Malcolm; the Ronin, a band of four survivors of a Skaarj attack on a human colony; Liandri, a series of advanced humanoid robots custom-built or retrofitted for combat; the Krall, a warlike race of aliens formerly under the leadership of the Skaarj, returning from their initial appearance in the original Unreal; and the Necris, warriors who have undergone the process of the same name, making them stronger at the expense of replacing their biological processes with \"Nanoblack\", effectively turning them into undead soldiers (hence the name, Necris). In the Campaign, players control members of the Ronin, and the Necris serve as the chief antagonists. \n \nIn the game's story, set in 2307, some years after the events of UT2004, a Necris attack occurs on a colony on unknown planet, releasing armed Kralls on the humans. The colony is defenseless, but a group of Ronins arrives on the scene, defending the survivors. Reaper, the group's leader, advises his second-in-command warrior Othello and his sister Jester to destroy the orbital Necris blockade with a fighter, and orders team's sniper expert, Bishop, to provide cover as he swarms to save the colony. Suddenly, he is caught in the explosion of an incoming rocket missile and passes out, but not before seeing an unknown Necris woman shooting a soldier next to him. Reaper is rescued by Othello and Jester and wakes up in the base of the Izanagi, a guerrilla force that fights against Necris and Axon, and he meets with the leader, revealed to be Malcolm, who also leads the Iron Guard as the Izanagi's army. He explains that the Necris attack was masterminded by Liandri, who also turn some of the Krall, into Necris, controlled undead soldiers. The unknown woman who Reaper saw turns out to be Akasha, the Necris operative who destroyed the colony and also leads the Necris forces. Reaper wants to kill her, but Malcolm tells him that he needs to prove himself first.","collection":156,"rating":80.0,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":80.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"version_parent":928,"version_title":"Black Edition","games":[103020,28029,103298,103281,306,90099,103301,68287,27011,32902],"tags":[1,18,268435461],"developers":[168],"publishers":[168],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2,3],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1198022400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1198022400000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Dec-19","y":2007,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sou9vxxwmddacne7j2gg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sou9vxxwmddacne7j2gg","width":1280,"height":1024}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h4yfhzwf6uhnfxucmoji.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h4yfhzwf6uhnfxucmoji","width":1528,"height":1915},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.unrealtournament3.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/13210"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament_3"}],"external":{"steam":"13210"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]},{"id":46625,"name":"Unreal II: The Awakening (Special Edition)","slug":"unreal-ii-the-awakening-special-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/unreal-ii-the-awakening-special-edition","created_at":1499641434719,"updated_at":1500470481873,"summary":"The Unreal adventure continues with the release of the action shooter Unreal II: The Awakening.

It was the second title released in On-Line Systems' Hi-Res Adventures series after Mystery House. \n \nWizard and the Princess is a prelude to the King's Quest series in both story and concept (though chronologically set several years before King's Quest V). It was also the first adventure game released with full color graphics. \n \nhe game (according to the backcover (box/folder/manual) of the Atari 400/800 and Apple II original and rerelease versions) takes place in the land of Serenia where King George's daughter Princess Priscilla has been kidnapped by an evil wizard named Harlin. Harlin has held her inside his castle far in the mountains. The King has offered half of his kingdom to anyone brave enough to travel to the Wizard's castle, defeat him and return his daughter. The player assumes the role of a happy wanderer who answers this challenge. \n \nThe re-releases (on Apple II, Atari 400/800, and the C64 port) contained additional plot added to the manual explaining how the wanderer made it to Serenia in the first place; some time long into the future after Harlin had been defeated by the Wanderer, he challenged the player to again repeat the actions leading to his defeat. He boasted of using his magic to change the world creating obstacles for anyone who would challenge him (he moved the desert around the village of Daventry, the northern sea splitting Serenia in two, and Great Mountains in the North on his half of the continent). He turned back the sands of time leaving the adventurer in the desert just outside the village of Serenia. He mocks the hero telling him that he may have been defeated once, but he couldn't be defeated a second time. The princess gives the hero some words of advice and a computer to help him defeat Harlin, and tells him he has become the wanderer (grandfather paradox \u0026 bootstrap paradox). The manual story as reprinted was also included with the Roberta Williams Collection (a compilation of games from Roberta Williams) and the King's Quest Collection Series (one of the compilations of King's Quest games). \n \nThe introduction for Adventure of Serenia, explained that the adventurer, with the help of a computer, had magically transported to Serenia to save the Princess.","collection":5085,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,22425,36926,25222,26766,41895,47823,25211,12198,55803],"tags":[268435487,536871059,536871208,536871931,536871939,536871958,536872140,536872293,536872419,536872668,536873192,536873308,536873400,536873454,536875172,536875442,536875699,536876082,536876274,536877593,536879818,536883320],"category":0,"keywords":[147,296,1019,1027,1046,1228,1381,1507,1756,2280,2396,2488,2542,4260,4530,4787,5170,5362,6681,8906,12408],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":381369600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":381369600000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Feb-01","y":1982,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Adventure in Serenia","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a5knlylzu3e7ttegyapz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a5knlylzu3e7ttegyapz","width":410,"height":480},"esrb":{"rating":5}},{"id":46637,"name":"Axia","slug":"axia","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/axia","created_at":1499641519905,"updated_at":1516374060518,"summary":"In this high-speed action space shoot-em-up, you're Max Dellamorte, a bounty hunter, passing through the Auburn Planetary System.

But, all of them lead Lucky to $1,000,000 for the capture of the Daltons.","collection":3175,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,10039,76246,19341,36781,68142,27523,28751,36718],"tags":[1,268435461,536870921,536871937,536874452,536875054,536875222,536875259],"category":0,"keywords":[9,1025,3540,4142,4310,4347],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":868579200000,"platforms":[7,19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":877910400000,"region":1,"human":"1997-Oct-27","y":1997,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":868579200000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Jul-11","y":1997,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mpaphktpk9hqyuzc9idm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mpaphktpk9hqyuzc9idm","width":1200,"height":675},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iiybxftgfyga6zsvf2hj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iiybxftgfyga6zsvf2hj","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qensfthfutry1c6gjc5r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qensfthfutry1c6gjc5r","width":972,"height":980}},{"id":46665,"name":"Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 - Road to Boruto","slug":"naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4-road-to-boruto","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4-road-to-boruto","created_at":1499687518134,"updated_at":1534365140646,"summary":"Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 - Road to Boruto is an Action game, developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Bandai Namco Games, which was released in Japan in 2017.","popularity":2.0,"games":[10039,103288,76736,103269,17548,37419,103298,76064,76885,103020],"tags":[1,268435460,536873173,536888720,536889192,536889193],"category":0,"keywords":[2261,17808,18280,18281],"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bp533phjhsyortubxjrl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bp533phjhsyortubxjrl","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nqke9ykh8hjqycvbw7fd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nqke9ykh8hjqycvbw7fd","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cjct2358wudbo9gcwhtx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cjct2358wudbo9gcwhtx","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s8cp7lsktnd2vwiazrwg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s8cp7lsktnd2vwiazrwg","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mezlpxkjbsybgclizs4d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mezlpxkjbsybgclizs4d","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h3jwdvrlnwyt9bgkazcl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h3jwdvrlnwyt9bgkazcl","width":1515,"height":1901},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.naruto-videogames.com/en/the-road-to-boruto-expansion-is-coming-to-naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4/"}]},{"id":46666,"name":"Earth Defense Force","slug":"earth-defense-force","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/earth-defense-force","created_at":1499687519714,"updated_at":1500623653618,"summary":"A SUPER SAGA OF 23RD CENTURY SATELLITE WARFARE! \n \nThe graphics will dozzle you, the speed will astound you... but if you don't think fast and shoot faster, you won't have a chance against the alien firestorm.

The plot: renegade robots have taken one of Mr. Spacely's sprocket plants. And George, his most stupid subordinate, may just be stupid enough to risk his life to get it back. You can choose to play as either George or Elroy in one-player mode, or play both characters with a friend in two-player hotseat mode.

There is also a strict time limit on each level in the form of energy counter: you will die when the countdown reaches zero.

The seeds were flung outward, toward the edge of the galaxy, beyond where Atlas’s power had ever reached. The seeds drifted for endless centuries. One by one, they were lost in the vast darkness between the stars. Only a single seed survived. Weakened and dying, Atlas’s instincts drove it toward the nearest suitable planet. This was Arctora, and it was not like anything the seed could have imagined. \n \nArctora was a world of metal and silver seas. Vast swathes of its surface had been sheared of all organic material, all an effort by a powerful artificial intelligence known as the Librarian to convert the planet into a single computer. Organic life had long become almost extinct, replaced by cybernetic servants to the Librarian. When Atlas’s seed landed and released its power, Arctora was changed forever. \n \nAtlas’s seed landed and its power surged through the land. With so little organic matter to work with, the power used what it had. Millions of new life forms, some organic, some cybernetic — but most of them a combination of both — were born instantly. Four essences, or Guardians, greater than the others, emerged from the seed. Calling themselves Gorok, Ometa, Apophis, and Hamaliel, they were created for the single purpose of guarding Atlas’s seed until it could regrow. Heroes, each sworn to one of the four guardians, flocked to the continent. There were no rules, no boundaries, no laws. The new land was full of dangers and demanded alliances - but alliances on Arctora are ephemeral things. Each Guardian was determined to be the one to find the energy source and regrow Atlas… and to take its power for itself.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[8773,25311,9789,26766,39257,55029,25300,19301,18811,22399],"tags":[18,268435467,268435468,268435471,536871060,536871882,536872383],"category":0,"keywords":[148,970,1471],"themes":[18],"genres":[11,12,15],"first_release_date":1474848000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1474848000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-26","y":2016,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e3wjjgezzey1xnjvv3ld.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e3wjjgezzey1xnjvv3ld","width":640,"height":360}},{"id":46727,"name":"Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch","slug":"ringworld-revenge-of-the-patriarch","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ringworld-revenge-of-the-patriarch","created_at":1499691610619,"updated_at":1515648710115,"summary":"A graphical adventure set in Larry Niven's \"Known Space\" universe.

Multiple gameplay modes are available, including survival mode where the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, an adventure mode where players play custom maps created by other players and a spectator mode. The PC version of the game is renowned for its third-party mods, which add various new items, characters, and quests to the game. \n \nThe alpha version was publicly released for PC on May 17, 2009, and after gradual updates, the full version was released on November 18, 2011. A version for Android was released a month earlier on October 7, and an iOS version was released on November 17, 2011.

On December 10, 2014, a Windows Phone version was released.[12] All versions of Minecraft receive periodic updates, with the console editions being co-developed by 4J Studios. \n \nMinecraft received five awards during the 2011 Game Developers Conference. Of the Game Developers Choice Awards, it won the Innovation Award, Best Downloadable Game Award, and Best Debut Game Award; from the Independent Games Festival, it won the Audience Award and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize. In 2012, Minecraft was awarded a Golden Joystick Award in the category Best Downloadable Game. As of June 2015, over 70 million copies had been sold, including 20 million between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One and 20 million on PC,[13] making it the best-selling PC game to date and the third best-selling video game of all time.

It would also be added to the Japanese Wii's Virtual Console in 2009. \n \nThe Arcade and Sharp X68000 versions use an isometric view while the PC Engine uses a standard overhead view. The game's platforms are all suspended over a bottomless void. Alice can shoot bubbles, technically termed \"shabon balls\", at the enemy in an effort to knock them off of the floating terrain or destroy them. Holding down the attack button will charge the bubble and make it larger, resulting in greater knockback strength or simply more damage, depending on the enemy. \n \nThe enemies are also trying to knock Alice off, too. In fact, Alice does not take damage in a conventional sense: the only way to lose a life is to fall in to the void. Alice comes equipped with several balloons which can rescue her from a fall should one occur.

The games were developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series. \n \nIt was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo's Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan?), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.[1] \n \nThe game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of a guardian spirit that accompanies each character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations on the character's move list and abilities. \n \nOriginal author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga.","franchise":419,"franchises":[419],"popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[75962,75964,75858,75857,75853,68609,55058,50726,50704,50586],"tags":[268435460,1073741828],"developers":[37],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":912556800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":912556800000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Dec-02","y":1998,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"JoJo's Venture","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"ジョジョの奇妙な冒険","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gfubxpcsbz9i4gwgwbra.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gfubxpcsbz9i4gwgwbra","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/knxlg8s72yn0vbo6x6bj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"knxlg8s72yn0vbo6x6bj","width":618,"height":348}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jsmwohzj7bybmxkkz1om.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jsmwohzj7bybmxkkz1om","width":350,"height":498}},{"id":46816,"name":"Naughty mouse","slug":"naughty-mouse","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/naughty-mouse","created_at":1499701185484,"updated_at":1500230817209,"summary":"Naughty Mouse, also known as Woodpecker, is a platform arcade game that had been released by Amenip Corporation in 1981; it runs upon Namco's Pac-Man hardware (a Zilog Z80, running at 3.072 MHz), with one of Namco's programmable sound generators running at 96 KHz for audio.

His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese ninja Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the \"Evil Seed\", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake. \n \nThree years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them three sacred weapons join once again.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75962,46815,75964,75858,75857,75853,68609,55058,50726,50704],"tags":[268435460],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":886291200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":886291200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Feb-01","y":1998,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mezdxuph5gtkkwplmr9l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mezdxuph5gtkkwplmr9l","width":1440,"height":1350}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yv1fkulssacv9bglwrj9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yv1fkulssacv9bglwrj9","width":850,"height":1187}},{"id":46832,"name":"Konami's Ping Pong","slug":"konamis-ping-pong","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/konamis-ping-pong","created_at":1499701523828,"updated_at":1500233841969,"summary":"A playable if simplistic Table Tennis simulation for one or two players.

The game uses two buttons - one is used to make the ship fire circular lasers, while the other is used to cycle through its four firing patterns. The red pattern is two lasers in a spiral pattern, while the blue one is one laser straight ahead and one behind, the yellow one is one laser straight ahead, one left, and one right and the green one is two lasers diagonally forward (one to the left and one to the right), and one straight behind; by holding down the button, the ship fires more powerful, spherical lasers. \n \nEven though the game is the sequel to Bosconian (which used a synthesized, DAC-generated voice saying \"Blast off!\" at the beginning of every round), Blast Off had more in common gameplay-wise with Namco's own Dragon Spirit than with Bosconian; this is especially noticeable in the third area of every world, where the player's ship undergoes an increase in size, and must destroy a boss. Despite several gameplay differences, the connection with Bosconian was emphasized in the marketing of the game, with the hexagonal space stations from Bosconian appearing in Namco's press literature, and on the game's title screen, and also making appearances in the game itself - and the game is also worth noting for its usages of various Engrish phrases, such as \"To push start only 1 player button\" (on title screen), \"Go next\" (at end of world), \"Congraturations\" (at end of game) and \"Entry your name\" (on high score table).

The player takes control of a star ship that can transform in to a mecha by obtaining a specific type of power up. \n \nSet in 2013, mankind's first artificial star and planet, \"Le Tau\", is under attack from genetically modified alien monsters. The player must navigate a \"Heavy Unit\", a heavily armed, transforming mecha, in order to defeat the onslaught and protect the human colony. \n \nThe player's ship had two forms: a space-ship and a giant robot. Players started controlling the Heavy Unit in its space-ship form as default. As they progressed, they could change the ship into its robot form, thus changing its firing mode and mobility. A checkpoint was active however and the Heavy Unit only had one hit. Power Ups are dropped by a specific enemy ship which appears in fixed points during the levels. Every level of the game contains a mid-boss and a final boss. Both the ship and the robot modes use two fire buttons, one for the primary (frontal) fire and one for auxiliary fire. The ship mode uses a frontal laser gun which becomes a spread show with the power ups, plus missiles which drops like bombs as auxiliary fire. The robot mode has a frontal laser gun which increases in power with the power ups plus homing missiles as auxiliary fire. An interesting element of the game is represented by the hidden bonuses (usually 1UP) which can be revealed by shooting certain parts of the scenario or by continuously hitting certain indestructible enemies. There is at least one hidden bonus in every level of the game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,10209,36950,28029,64204,10213,27314,11253,71455,10210],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871079,536871882,536875055],"category":0,"keywords":[166,167,970,4143],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":570672000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":570672000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Feb-01","y":1988,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ccvkns6hzw88ivk4e8vr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ccvkns6hzw88ivk4e8vr","width":916,"height":1280}},{"id":46860,"name":"Megablast","slug":"megablast","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/megablast","created_at":1499702663106,"updated_at":1500238052333,"summary":"Megablast (メガブラスト) is a 1989 Horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game released by Taito in Europe and Japan.

According to the manual of the game, tapeworms live in bean patches, love to eat fruit and are preyed upon by other critters named Beeky the Bird, Spanky the Spider and Mystery Beetle. Uhhhh, right. \nOur hero here is Slinky, a tapeworm who's patrolling the local bean patch. In order for him to get to the fruit he loves, he has to slither around the screen eating up all the beans. He consumes them by touching a bean with his head (merely a yellow square), and by doing so, another bean appears somewhere else on the screen, and then you're off again. The more beans Slinky eats, the longer he grows. Which is a problem. As you steer the worm through the bean patch, you need to take great care not to coil him back over himself because, omnivore that he is, Slinky will eat himself. \n \nDon't tread too gingerly because while Slinky is hot after those beans, a beetle is moving across the bottom of the screen, outside the patch, bearing down on something you're supposed to believe is an apple (on later levels, different fruits take the apple's place.) Trust me when I say that it takes a great imagination to believe the block graphics resemble anything you'd find at a farmer's market. Anyway, if the beetle gets to the fruit before Slinky eats his bean, two more beans appear on the screen and Slinky has to eat them, too. Other predators include the Mystery Beetle, Beeky and Spanky. They bleep across the bean patch at random intervals. If they happen to touch Slinky's head, it's curtains for the worm. \n \nTaken as a whole, Tapeworm isn't too bad. It borrows elements from Atari's Surround and Rock-Ola's obscure Nibbler.

You take control of goofy as he competes in two events, the Marathon Dive and the Pogo Pop. \n \nThe Marathon Dive is a game in which you must guide Goofy up a series of platforms so he can reach the diving platform and jump off before the timer runs out. As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around. Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level). Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over. If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life. \n \nIf Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air. Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below. However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough. If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion). If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim). As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically. Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again. \n \nPogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile. This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land. As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor.  \n \nWhile you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points. The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,55715,40524,14713,23175,16468,1070,2940,68324],"tags":[1,268435470],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":427075200000,"platforms":[66],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":66,"date":427075200000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Jul-15","y":1983,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zn2gajypfpwjfmzivqsp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zn2gajypfpwjfmzivqsp","width":1440,"height":1080}},{"id":46908,"name":"Microgammon SB","slug":"microgammon-sb","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/microgammon-sb","created_at":1499705082181,"updated_at":1500285016668,"summary":"Microgammon SB originally started out as an Apple IIe game.

They were imprisoned in the few gigantic Star Cruisers of the Guardians. \n \nThen the Guardians claimed that humankind can only survive if they are united, and form the future together. Together, they can be safe. It was a principle that was accepted for a short while, but fanaticism started to slowly take over the Guardian leaders. When they began to see the enemy in everyone, even executing people without much reason, the humans finally started to see what kind of people were controlling them. \n \nThis was the time when more than two million people stole ships from the hangars, and left the Guardian Cruisers far behind. A few million followed in the coming years. \n \nThe Guardians declared these people the 'Pirate horde', and finally, they had a reason to unite. Everyone who remained on the Cruisers became a Guardian, and from then on, the Guardian and Pirate became factions. \n \nHistorians tend to call this separation of human factions 'The Shattering'. \n \nTwo hundred years later the Pirate Wars are still devastating, and even on the brink of extinction, humankind keeps on fighting. \n \nAnarchy, struggle and fighting against each other... instead of doing the right thing.

The game was inspired by Settlers II™ (© Bluebyte) but has significantly more variety and depth to it. Still, it is easy to get started through playable tutorials. \n \nIn Widelands, you are the regent of a small clan. You start out with nothing but your headquarters, where all your resources are stored. \n \nIn the course of the game, you will build an ever growing settlement. Every member of your clan will do his or her part to produce more resources - wood, food, iron, gold and more - to further this growth. The economic network is complex and different in the three tribes (Barbarians, Imperials, and Atlanteans). \n \nAs you are not alone in the world, you will meet other clans sooner or later. Some of them may be friendly and you may eventually trade with them. However, if you want to rule the world, you will have to train soldiers and fight. \n \nWidelands offers a unique style of play. For example, a system of roads plays a central role in your economy: all the goods that are harvested and processed by the tribe must be transported from one building to the next. This is done by carriers, and those carriers always walk along the roads. It is your job to lay out the roads as efficiently as possible. \n \nAnother refreshing aspect of the game is the way you command your clan. There is no need to tell every single one of your subjects what to do - that would be impossible, because there can be thousands of them! Instead, all you need to do is order them to build a building somewhere, and the builders will come. Similarly, whenever you want to attack an enemy, just place an order to attack one of their barracks, and your soldiers will march to fight. You're really a ruler: You delegate in times of war and in times of peace! \n \nWidelands offers single-player mode with different campaigns; the campaigns all tell stories of tribes and their struggle in the Widelands universe! However, settling really starts when you unite with friends over the Internet or LAN to build up new empires together - or to crush each other in the dusts of war.

It is therefore unlikely that Take-Two will produce any additional versions of Links.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14]},{"id":47121,"name":"Ultimate Race Pro","slug":"ultimate-race-pro","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ultimate-race-pro","created_at":1499714281862,"updated_at":1513068184107,"summary":"A compilation of three Pac-Man PC games.","collection":2095,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"keywords":[960],"themes":[1],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t5xq1h6s0itlathitk2u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t5xq1h6s0itlathitk2u","width":185,"height":273}},{"id":47122,"name":"Cabel 2","slug":"cabel-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cabel-2","created_at":1499714282880,"updated_at":1500455485908,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47123,"name":"Carrier Strike","slug":"carrier-strike","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/carrier-strike","created_at":1499714284614,"updated_at":1513072059296,"summary":"Carrier Strike is probably as close to a being a text game as any graphics game released. There are graphics but nothing more than basic icon-on-map bare essentials. That may sound like a bad thing but in reality it's not since Carrier Strike more than makes up for that shortcoming by offering intense and detailed game play. The game is based on a fairly simple premise: have your carriers kick the stuffing out of their carriers. But the rub here is that in order to do that, you've got to find their carriers first. In a decidedly cat-and-mouse fashion, each day that dawns on the high seas of the South Pacific will find you desperately searching through bad weather, rough conditions or simply the enormous body of water to just locate the enemy before any sort of military action can take place. If you're an expert who knows the historically correct Japanese hiding spots, the designer has seen you coming and offers a random enemy placement option to keep you guessing. \n \nWhat makes Carrier Strike a challenging game, though, is the balancing act you'll be required to perform as the area commander over all the actions a carrier is capable of during war. Eventually, once you've found your targets, you'll quickly find yourself hip deep in the dizzying tasks of assigning combat air patrols for defense of your task force, managing weapons load-outs and fueling of various types of aircraft, giving orders for searches or air attacks, monitoring other ships and generally just holding the whole ball of wax together. All of this is accomplished through a turn-based system where each turn equals twenty minutes of real time. This becomes a factor in some operations and can lead to confusion or wasted blocks of time if your coordination skills are lacking. The hardware in Carrier Strike mirrors the actual weaponry, ships and planes that were used in the South Pacific during WWII. Outside influences such as the introduction of better radar and the slow decline of the enemy's pilot efficiency are realistically phased in during the game. Fortunately, the interface is fairly simple and easy to use since you'll need all your time coordinating events. \n \nUltimately, Carrier Strike will appeal to those war gamers who bask in statistics and a realistically based war machine. Those looking for flashy graphics and killer cut scenes won't find them here. Be prepared for a logistical and strategic exercise when in command of your Carrier Strike. Fast thinking and calm nerves will be a plus when faced with operating elevators bringing aircraft up to the deck while under heavy enemy fire and at the same time coordinating their missile and bomb loads, take off and mission orders. Selecting the appropriate aircraft and weapons based on what your search planes find requires precise scheduling and prompt decision making. Carrier Strike offers an accurate, enjoyable simulation of carrier warfare in the South Pacific.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44242,18623,29173,55689,33603,11419,36962,55888,55590,65827],"tags":[268435469,268435471,536872060],"category":0,"keywords":[1148],"genres":[13,15]},{"id":47124,"name":"Alchemilla","slug":"alchemilla","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/alchemilla","created_at":1499714289129,"updated_at":1500457654683,"summary":"Alchemilla Mod is an attempt to recreate original atmosphere of cult game Silent Hill on the Source Engine.

He dreamed about completing his father’s work, and spent countless hours imagining there was someone out there listening. Daniel was only 12, but like his father was obsessed with the idea that we were not alone in the universe. His imagination ran wild as he began flipping switches, twisting knobs, turning dials. This is the unknown story of why They are here... \n \nDecades later, alien ships began entering Earth’s atmosphere. At first, contact was peaceful...but then something happened. Computers around the world began malfunctioning. Self-driving cars would crash into each other. Cellphones would overheat and catch fire. Rockets would explode on their launch pads. The humans blamed the Aurayu, but they were battling problems of their own. Their biomechanical immunity implants, which make their long lifespans possible, were failing, and their ships began behaving erratically.  \n \nNeither species really knows who shot first. But what we do know is further attempts by either side to improve their technology to combat these malfunctions and defend themselves only made things worse. Some thing happened. They weren’t created. They weren’t programmed. They just were. They call themselves IO. A bit of human and a bit of Aurayu, this new artificial species assembled an army of their own.  \n \nYou are a combatant of this war. Will you defend your race from the intrusion of your enemies as a Human? Will you exact revenge on your creators as the IO? Or will you conquer the blue marble for the honor of the Aurayu? Collect resources, conquer enemy territory, and build towers to ensure victory for your race. Be the first to claim your neighborhood, town, and city! \n \nChoose a side, and enlist now…before it’s too late. \n \nTerra Mango awaits you.","popularity":2.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741827],"developers":[13103],"game_engines":[404],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[464],"themes":[38,41],"genres":[11,15,31,32],"status":3,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":39,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":34,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i9fh5s4qs4dagpfbb6ou.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i9fh5s4qs4dagpfbb6ou","width":3840,"height":2165}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"OHHqCrPx0WM"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pdwbwozcp9gpx2fyvmnf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pdwbwozcp9gpx2fyvmnf","width":3500,"height":3500},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVktivTi-cxGNC0w__ROcZw"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/terramango"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/terramango"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/terramangogame"},{"category":1,"url":"https://terramango.com"}]},{"id":47142,"name":"The Survivors","slug":"the-survivors","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-survivors","created_at":1499740479969,"updated_at":1500019078614,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,25646,25311,68287,71455,29525,51978,36950,36608,25300],"tags":[1,18,268435465,536873922,1073741827],"publishers":[13105],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3010],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[134,93,69,65,15,26,25,94,27],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":134,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":94,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":93,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":69,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/exzofxjbejheojugkec9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"exzofxjbejheojugkec9","width":1000,"height":1557}},{"id":47143,"name":"Sceptre of Bagdad","slug":"sceptre-of-bagdad","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sceptre-of-bagdad","created_at":1499742070998,"updated_at":1513023119036,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19289,37094,26848,25222,25646,236,37088,47823,16468,27266],"tags":[1,17,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871939,1073741828],"developers":[13106],"publishers":[13107,13105],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1027],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[8,9,31],"first_release_date":567907200000,"platforms":[15,26],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":757296000000,"region":1,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wypucysss1zpazujw3wa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wypucysss1zpazujw3wa","width":800,"height":1253}},{"id":47144,"name":"Red Scorpion","slug":"red-scorpion","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/red-scorpion","created_at":1499742574223,"updated_at":1509722615697,"storyline":"RED SCORPION \n \n \nMERCENARY FOR POWER AGENCY LTD \n \nTOP SECRET \n \nDear Volunteer \nI am pleased to inform you of \nyour selection for service in the \nTerran Confederation Star \nCommandos. \n\tThe Confederation Star \nCommandos are a proud and \nelite corps with exacting \nrequirements and superior \ncombat skills. You must \nunderstand that failure of a \nmission will not be tolerated - \nand this fact cannot be \nemphasized enough. \n\tI must say I am impressed with \nyour track record. The \nCommanding Officer of Tutmos \nIII had a lot of praise for your \ndedication and stamina while \nposted as an instructor at the \nMobile Organic Sanitation Unit. \n\tYour first combat tour of duty is \nthe Bombyx Moons. These are a \nlarge number of small planetoids \nin the 97th Quadrant. They lie \nexactly between the Terran \nConfederation and our galactic \nsuperpower rival, The Necron Empire. \n\tThe Bombyx are rather a \nprimitive people -they program \ntheir computers!!! In fact no-one \nwould even give them a second \nglance but for the fact that the \nmoons are virtually pure Talanite. \n\tThe evil Necrons are intent on \ndominating the Bombyx. They \nare literally \"stealing\" the \nBombyx's Talanite in exchange \nfor worthless trash. I personally \nwould describe it as an inter- \nplanetary rip-off!!! We, on the \nother hand, are going to bring \nthe Bombyx all the benefits of \nTerran Civilisation - pulpburgers, \nsynthocola -you know, that sort \nof thing - in exchange for a few \nTalanite crystals (40 Gigatonnes \nper oscillation). \n\tI have enclosed copies of full \ndetails of the mission and a \ndescription of the equipment \n---------------------------- \nwhich will be issued to you. This \nequipment (The Multi-Role \nInfantry Combat Capsule) has \nonly just been released by the \n\"boffins\". It is, therefore, \nimperative that you read and \ninwardly digest the information \nconcerning its operation. \n \nMission Details: \nThe Assault Carrier \"Coral Sea\" \nand the Battle Cruiser \"Zhukov\" \nare to proceed to the Bombyx \nMoons. Star Commandos will be \ndropped onto the surface of the \nMoons. Their mission is to \neliminate Necrons and all \nBombyx military and \ncommunication installations \nand personnel. In addition, all \nstructures connected with the \nmining or utilisation of Talanite \nare to be destroyed. Bombyx \ncivilians and their homes are to \nbe unharmed. Any commando \ndisobeying the rules of \nengagement will be punished. \n(It must be remembered we are \nhere to liberate these people.) \n \nEquipment Details: \n \nMURICC: \nThe Multi-Role Infantry Combat \nCapsule or Death Scorpion MkIV \nis the most powerful infantry \nweapon developed so far. \n\tThe commando has a CAV \n(Combat Action Visor) through \nwhich he views the combat \narea. Information is flashed up \naround the visor through the \nHUDWAS (Head Up Display \nWeapon Aiming System). This \nmeans the commando never \nhas to look down at the vehicle's \ncontrols. Vision through the CAV \nis aided by AVS (Augmented \nVision System). \n \nAVS: \nThe commando can select from \n4 modes of the electromagnetic \nspectrum. Natural light is \nbasically equivalent to human \nvision. Microwave can be used to \nsee through camouflage or \n------------------------- \ndetect underground \ninstallations. Infra Red detects \nfast moving objects and Talanite \nis sensitive to Ultra Violet. \n \nWeapons: \nThe Death Scorpion is equipped \nwith a Tomatak particle cannon \ncapable of destroying most \nmobile or small soft targets. \nPlease note after repeated fire \nthe cannon gets hot and its \neffect weakens. It will be \nnecessary to close the target or \nallow the cannon barrels to cool. \nArmour Piercing (AP) missiles are \navailable for hard or buried \ntargets. Cluster Bomb (CB) \nmissiles take out large soft \ntargets. All weapons range to \nthe horizon. \n \nDefence: \nThe cannon can be used in \ndefence - particularly in Sight \nMode. There are Sonic Stunners \nwhich will temporarily paralyse \naliens. But beware! They will also \ndamage the Death Scorpion's \nshields. An Electronic Warfare \n(EW) system, capable of \nexploding the proximity fuses \nin Necron missiles, is a standard \nfitting. \n \nThreat Detection: \nDeath Scorpions are equipped \nwith a variety of threat detectors. \nAround the AVS screen are 4 \ndetectors which are activated \nwhen different objects are in \nrange. The one marked 'B' lights \nup when there is an above- \nground structure nearby. \nSimilarly, the 'T' detector \nindicates a Talanite mine in close \nproximity, while 'W' warns of a \nweapon-armed alien. 'M' lights \nup when a Necron missile is \nabout to strike the craft. In \naddition, the \"Coral Sea\" will \nbeam down a message warning \nwhen a Necron missile launch \noccurs. \n\tAs an \"extra\" the Boffins have \nfitted a sophisticated Electronic \nIntelligent (Elint) computer. This \n---------------------------------- \nidentifies objects under the \ngunsight and puts up a \nmessage, and possibly a picture, \nusing HUDWAS. \n \nDamage: \nWhen a MURICC is hit by enemy \nfire, the energy shields are \ndamaged. Their condition is \nindicated on the 'E' light as a \ntwo figure number. The shields \nare part of the anti-grav thrust \nmotors which will fail when the \nshields energy rating = 0. The \ncraft will then be destroyed by \nthe first alien to hit it. \n \nCommunication: \nThe are two communication \nchannels. Selecting the \"Coral \nSea\" channel puts out a \nrendezvous call to the assault \ncarrier which is in low \ngeostationary orbit. You will be \ntractor-beamed up. The \n\"Zhukov\" channel requests heavy \nfire support from the \nbattle cruiser. This will destroy \nanything in the area and will do \nsome damage to your shields. \nNaval heavy cannon also \noverheat with repeated fire and \ntake a long time to cool. \n \nNavigation: \nThe geocompass is used for \nnavigation. \n \nPromotion: \nYou will be promoted if you \nundertake successful missions. \nMedals will be awarded for \ndistinguished service. Since the \nTerran Star Commandos have \nan exemplary combat record, \nfailure is not permitted. You will \nstart as a Drop Commando. \n \nGAMEPLAY \n \nA Kempston joystick can be used \nto control movement.

\nColby is an arcade game featuring an imaginary character who takes on many interesting challenges including various obstacles with the goal of remaining alive for as long as possible, discovering the marvellous programme consisting of several worlds on its way. The aim of game itself is to achieve the highest score possible. \nThe game involves dynamic character controlling, entertaining additional features and enables players to compete against each other. \n \n•\tFeatures \no\tTilt mode character control \no\tDynamic exchange of worlds \no\tInteresting obstacle course \no\tCompetition between players via Facebook and Google \no\tCoin collection combined with a plentiful market \no\tThe game is suitable for all age groups \no\tDynamic animations and accompanying sounds \no\tMobile phone mode (Game adjustment to make it suitable for mobile phone play) \n \n•\tGameplay \nThe aim of the game is to understand just how easy it is to control and play, but, at the same time, how difficult it is to achieve a high score. The mentioned score, which enables constant competition among players, is achieved by maintaining balance and avoiding obstacles.  \n‘’Tilt’’ play method makes character control all the more entertaining and the game’s dynamic edge is achieved through the world-to-world transition feature throughout the entirety of its course. \nThe game features includes coin collection used to shop in a plentiful market, where players are given the opportunity to give their character an interesting upgrade. \nEach world is presented in a 2D technique and includes various obstacles characteristic for the world the player is currently in. Worlds end in 2D technique and feature a dynamic transition onto the next one. \n \n•\tThe course of the game \nThe game begins on a balanced surface. Character movement and balance maintenance are made difficult by obstacles falling onto the course. Aside from the obstacles themselves, the players are encouraged to collect coins, as the game includes negative bonuses which induce the occurrence of new obstacles and difficulties for the character.

When the train is in motion the player must maintain the correct speed, steam pressure and other operational parameters of the train; also, the player must attempt to shoot down Nazi fighter planes which occasionally strafe the train by aiming and firing anti-aircraft guns mounted to the engine of the train. When the train occasionally stops briefly for resupply at various train stations, the player also must provide cover fire against attackers in the station buildings for comrades resupplying the train. \n \nThe Train was initially released for several 8-bit computer platforms, including the Commodore 64 and Apple II series, on which it was fairly popular. The game was also later released on IBM PC.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[17446,19341,36594,34919,44242,22399,640,19934,36718,10403],"tags":[1,39,268435461,268435469,536870931,536872060,536873753,536875058,536875059,536875137,536877928,1073741825],"developers":[13361],"publishers":[547],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[19,1148,2841,4146,4147,4225,7016],"themes":[1,39],"genres":[5,13],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[13,15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":599529600000,"region":2,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":539136000000,"region":2,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/laphh2sdzjums7b0dagx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"laphh2sdzjums7b0dagx","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zlplt01uxd3n5swruxsz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zlplt01uxd3n5swruxsz","width":1000,"height":1296}},{"id":47184,"name":"Rocketball","slug":"rocketball","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rocketball","created_at":1499861834290,"updated_at":1500285180578,"summary":"Rocketball is based on the futuristic sports movie Rollerball, released in 1975, starring James Caan.

The object of the game is to score points by throwing a softball-sized metal ball into a cone-shaped goal target inset into the wall of the arena. Balls are fired into play, in the same direction players skate, by cannons when play begins and to restart play after the ball rolls out of play or a goal is scored. \n \nEach Rocketball team has five active players on roller skates. The four Rocketball teams are Houston (wearing blue), Tokyo (yellow), Moscow (burgundy) and Madrid (Green), which correspond to futuristic city states[4] \n \nRocketball is a full-contact sport in which players have considerable leeway to attack opposing players in order to take or maintain possession of the ball and to score points. Players can use fists, elbows and knees to disable their opponents. \n \nGames have a duration of ten minutes. A typical game will see no more than 15 goals scored in aggregate. Unlike the movie, there are no players riding motorcycles in the computer game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":476064000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":476064000000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Feb-01","y":1985,"m":2}]},{"id":47185,"name":"Leaderboard Executive Edition","slug":"leaderboard-executive-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/leaderboard-executive-edition","created_at":1499861841052,"updated_at":1500285181344,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":539136000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}]},{"id":47186,"name":"Eddie Kidd Jump Challenge","slug":"eddie-kidd-jump-challenge","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/eddie-kidd-jump-challenge","created_at":1499861844588,"updated_at":1515717467049,"summary":"Eddie Kidd Jump Challenge is a 1985 vehicle simulation game released for the Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron and BBC Micro, licensed by British stunt performer, Eddie Kidd.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,70321,43449,43254,39626,23835,54662,33644,15851,23314],"tags":[268435466,268435470,536872078,536875139],"category":0,"keywords":[1166,4227],"genres":[10,14],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ogamban5ygww7gtqslne.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ogamban5ygww7gtqslne","width":179,"height":270}},{"id":47187,"name":"Richard Petty's Talladega","slug":"richard-pettys-talladega","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/richard-pettys-talladega","created_at":1499861846698,"updated_at":1515647286856,"summary":"\"Richard Petty's Talladega is a racing game where you get to take the super speedway as you race against king Richard Petty and 18 top pro drivers.

Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in Byte Magazine and mailed $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer.[1] Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. For example, the March–April 1979 issue of Recreational Computing describes a project that converted Sargon to an 8080 program by using macros. Later the Spracklens were contacted by Hayden Books and a book was published.[4] \n \nCommercialization through electronic media \nWhen magnetic media publishing became widely available, a Navy Petty Officer, Paul Lohnes, ported Sargon to the TRS-80, altering both graphics, input, and housekeeping routines leaving the Spracklen's chess-playing algorithm intact. Paul consulted with the Spracklens, both living in San Diego at the time, to make the TRS-80 version an instant success with the help of Hayden Book's newly established software division: Hayden Software. Paul was not involved in further refinements to the TRS-80 version due to his reassignment to sea duty shortly after signing the deal with Hayden Software. In the early 1980s SARGON CHESS was ported to several earlier microcomputers, i.e. NASCOM (by Bits \u0026 PCs, 1981), Exidy Sorcerer, Sharp MZ 80K,[5] and many others. A complete rewrite was necessary later for the Apple II port, made by Kathleen's brother Gary Shannon. Both were published by Hayden Software. \n \nSequels \nThe Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program[1] and released Sargon II. In 1978 it tied for third at the ninth North American Computer Chess Championship despite being seeded ninth of 12 entries. Sargon finished only behind Belle and Chess 4.7, and defeated AWIT—running on a $5 million Amdahl mainframe—amazing the audience.[6][3][1] That year they published a series of articles in BYTE on computer chess programming,[2][7] stating \"we think it would be nice if not everyone had to reinvent the wheel\".[6] \n \nSargon II was ported to a variety of personal computers popular in the early 1980s.[8] The game engine featured multiple levels of lookahead to make it more accessible to beginning chess players. BYTE in 1980 estimated that Sargon II had a 1500 rating at the highest tournament-time difficulty level, and speculated that it was the best chess program on sale, including dedicated devices.[9] \n \nSargon 2.5, sold as a ROM module for the Chafitz Modular Game System, was identical to Sargon II but incorporated pondering.[10] It received a 1641 rating at the Paul Masson tournament in June–July 1979, and 1736 at the San Jose City College Open in January 1980.[3] \n \nSargon 3.0 finished in seventh place at the October 1979 North American Computer Chess Championship. The competition had improved, but 3.0 drew against Cray Blitz and easily defeated Mychess, its main microcomputer rival. In December 3.0 easily won the second microcomputer championship in London.[3] \n \nIn 1980, the Spracklens' Reversi game finished in first place at a computer tournament at Northwestern University, and in 1981 it finished in third place at the Santa Cruz Open Othello Tournament.[11] \n \nSargon III was a complete rewrite from scratch. Instead of an exchange evaluator, this version used a capture search algorithm. Also included was a chess opening repertoire. This third version was written originally for the 6502 assembler and was commercially published by Hayden Software in 1983. Apple contacted the Spracklens and, after a port for 68000 assembly, Sargon III was the first third-party executable software for the Macintosh.[1] \n \nAfter the demise of Hayden Software, later chess programs were also released under the name Sargon, including Sargon IV (Spinnaker Software), Sargon V (Activision) and a CD-i title simply named Sargon Chess. The Spracklens concurrently wrote the engines for the dedicated chess computers produced by Fidelity Electronics, which won the first four World Microcomputer Chess Championships.","collection":5006,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"keywords":[380,415,1166,1361,1923,2071,3782,4248,4346,5137,5821],"genres":[14,15],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Sargon 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y5jp2huijh08yv9zlr4m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y5jp2huijh08yv9zlr4m","width":560,"height":384}},{"id":47210,"name":"F1 GP Circuits","slug":"f1-gp-circuits","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/f1-gp-circuits","created_at":1499862373210,"updated_at":1500285212840,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}]},{"id":47211,"name":"Honey Bee","slug":"honey-bee","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/honey-bee","created_at":1499862375859,"updated_at":1528486672061,"summary":"Queen Bee is very annoyed at the fact that honey production is very low.

At its peak, GEOS was the third-most-popular microcomputer operating system in the world in terms of units shipped, trailing only MS-DOS and Mac OS (besides the original Commodore 64's KERNAL).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[80212,79797,65926,14169,80834,80714,80301,79246,79126,78320],"tags":[268435486,536871846,536875412,536875416,536879173],"category":0,"keywords":[934,4500,4504,8261],"genres":[30],"first_release_date":507600000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":507600000000,"region":8,"human":"1986-Feb-01","y":1986,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j7tv6wn9fcxcrlmqezev.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j7tv6wn9fcxcrlmqezev","width":884,"height":1150}},{"id":47242,"name":"Merlin 64","slug":"merlin-64","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/merlin-64","created_at":1499863147764,"updated_at":1500285270113,"summary":"Merlin was a macroassembler developed by mathematics professor Glen Bredon, initially running on the Apple II family under DOS 3.3, for the 6502 processor.

A maze of streets, alleyways and cul-de-sacs are laid out, populated by bizarre characters, some helpful and some deadly. \n \nThe street names are named after famous songs (\"Blackberry Way\", \"Desolation Row\", etc.) - a map was provided in the cassette inlay - and some of the characters reference others (one to avoid is the Psycho Killer, while the Jumpin' Jack Flash It's A Gas Gas Gas takes you to a tape's location).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":476064000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":476064000000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Feb-01","y":1985,"m":2}]},{"id":47255,"name":"Tom \u0026 Jerry Popper","slug":"tom-and-jerry-popper","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tom-and-jerry-popper","created_at":1499863577370,"updated_at":1500285502101,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9]},{"id":47256,"name":"Frog Boaster","slug":"frog-boaster","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/frog-boaster","created_at":1499863579337,"updated_at":1500267704774,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47257,"name":"Fowling","slug":"fowling","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fowling","created_at":1499863581571,"updated_at":1500285502439,"summary":"Russian variation of Egg.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47258,"name":"Sleep Walker","slug":"sleep-walker","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sleep-walker","created_at":1499863584972,"updated_at":1500267685805,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47259,"name":"Hippo Teeth - Sport","slug":"hippo-teeth-sport","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hippo-teeth-sport","created_at":1499863586786,"updated_at":1500267609649,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47260,"name":"Hot Line","slug":"hot-line","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hot-line","created_at":1499863596831,"updated_at":1515784725635,"summary":"Hot Line is an electro-mechanical pinball machine from 1966.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[79196,79195,76836,71262,67537,67531,67509,67488,67480,67470],"tags":[268435486,536871846,536875411,536875412,536875656],"category":0,"keywords":[934,4499,4500,4744],"genres":[30],"pulse_count":1,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ej2rm1opkehviuw7iwr2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ej2rm1opkehviuw7iwr2","width":844,"height":1084}},{"id":47261,"name":"Hot Line - Sport","slug":"hot-line-sport","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hot-line-sport","created_at":1499863598102,"updated_at":1500267591542,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47262,"name":"Tennis Menace - Sport","slug":"tennis-menace-sport","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tennis-menace-sport","created_at":1499863601185,"updated_at":1500267558087,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47263,"name":"Towering Rescue","slug":"towering-rescue","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/towering-rescue","created_at":1499863604295,"updated_at":1500267549561,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47264,"name":"Grab Man","slug":"grab-man","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/grab-man","created_at":1499863622835,"updated_at":1500267532757,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47265,"name":"Explorers of Space","slug":"explorers-of-space","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/explorers-of-space","created_at":1499863624898,"updated_at":1500267515853,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47266,"name":"Engine Room","slug":"engine-room","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/engine-room","created_at":1499863626814,"updated_at":1500267498787,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47267,"name":"Crazy Chewy","slug":"crazy-chewy","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crazy-chewy","created_at":1499863629604,"updated_at":1500267465387,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47268,"name":"Condor","slug":"condor","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/condor","created_at":1499863632078,"updated_at":1500267456879,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":47269,"name":"Forget-Me-Not","slug":"forget-me-not","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/forget-me-not","created_at":1499863711570,"updated_at":1500271002655,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gsqgwvzs5b302qdt27ms.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gsqgwvzs5b302qdt27ms","width":1920,"height":1080}},{"id":47270,"name":"Super Stickman Golf","slug":"super-stickman-golf","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-stickman-golf","created_at":1499863712789,"updated_at":1515860874929,"summary":"An addicting physics-based golf game with over 260 holes.

Ghosts and Munchman can never fully occupy the same space and so collisions are unrealistic. Ghosts do not change colour once you've eaten a power star, there's just an irritating clicking noise instead. But was quality an issue back then? Nope. It was enough to own one of these things to be the most popular kid in the class on \"bring your games day\". This toy lights up, and board games just can't compare to that. It also plays the same start-game music of the original Pac-Man arcade machine. \n \nHowever, the product design of the game itself is gorgeous. There's no mistaking the casing for anything else, looking like a giant yellow munchman-UFO hybrid. The electronics inside this casing occupy less than 50% of the internal space.

The components have been designed to provide you with a very realistic model of the real world to both electronically and graphically simulate strategic and tactical confrontation between world powers. \n \nElectronic land, sea and air forces can be deployed against each other in any combination and are totally dependent on supplies which are represented by energy units. \n \nThe game board is a true-to-life model of the relationships between countries of the real world in the early 1980's. \n \nForty-three countries have been divided into eleven \"politectonic\" or geo-political zones. Each country has been weighted with a power base figure that reflects its capability to persuade other nations to conform to its wishes - by diplomatic coercion or by direct military force. \n \nThese figures are based on the formula created by Ray S. Cline, formerly Deputy Director of Intelligence for the C.I.A. \n \nPp = (C+E+M)x(S+W) \n \nPERCEIVED POWER = (Critical Mass (Population + Territory) + Economic Capability + Military Capability) x (Strategic Purpose + National Will). \n \nFuture shifts in world power and change in governments will - of course - make changes in these numeric weightings appropriate. Players can feel free to sustain realism by changing the numbers assigned to each country as life goes on. \n \nIf you play other war games such as those published by Avalon Hill and SPI, you will find that the computer cartridge interfaces very effectively with them. The onscreen combats will generate much more excitement and realism than the usual dice provided to resolve conflicts. Onscreen energy units can be programmed into the computer to reflect the relative strength between different forces. The differential between the onscreen energy units at the end of each battle can also be applied to the combat results tables that come with these games. \n \nConquest of the World is the first game of its kind, so be ready for many unusual features. Take the rules one step at a time and you will find it to be a fascinating game of endless challenge - which, once learned, is not at all difficult to explain to others. \n \nTHE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME is to lead your Homeland to world domination through negotiations, conquests and alliances. Each successful conquest and alliance you make will strengthen your country's power base. The country with the strongest power base at the end of the game is the winner.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":349833600000,"platforms":[88],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":88,"date":349833600000,"region":8,"human":"1981-Feb-01","y":1981,"m":2}]},{"id":47294,"name":"Money Town","slug":"money-town","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/money-town","created_at":1499864148081,"updated_at":1500285535065,"summary":"The fun way to teach kids the value of money. \n \nFun and funds go hand in hand when you put your money where your mouth is- with Money Town, the joy-filled multimedia adventure that teaches your child all the basics about dollars and cents. \n \nAs kids help Greenstreet's coolest characters earn money to reopen their town park, they'll click-and-discover a merry world full of animated money facts, figures, songs and surprises that will send them giggling all the way to the bank.

It was developed by EA Tiburon and released on August 31, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox and on September 4, 2004 for the GameCube. NASCAR 2005 is the first game in the series to drop the word Thunder from the title since NASCAR 2001. Kevin Harvick, driver of the #29 GM Goodwrench Chevy Monte Carlo, appeared on the cover. It also marks the first time the original PlayStation has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup. This was the first NASCAR edition to be released exclusively on six generation home consoles. \n \nUnlike previous entries, which would normally add a few extra features but leave most of the game identical to its predecessor, the game brought massive change to the series. One example is the inclusion of NASCAR series other than the NEXTEL Cup Series; the National Series (Busch Series), the Craftsman Truck Series, and the Featherlite Modified Series, plus muscle cars. More examples include the implementation of NASCAR's new Chase for the Cup points system, and Fight to the Top mode, where the player controls a custom driver throughout his career starting in the lower series and working up the ladder (similar to NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona). Another change is the absence of the cockpit view and the absence of makes and models in the Truck series, all of which appear to be Ford F-150s. Also due to failed negotiations Pocono Raceway is not included. This was the last NASCAR game released for the Nintendo GameCube. The score is composed by David Robidoux.[1","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1096588800000,"platforms":[11],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1096588800000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Oct-01","y":2004,"m":10}]},{"id":47317,"name":"Ultra Bust-A-Move","slug":"ultra-bust-a-move","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ultra-bust-a-move","created_at":1499865172164,"updated_at":1515845054807,"summary":"Puzzle Bobble (Japanese: パズルボブル Hepburn: Pazuru Boburu?), also known as Bust-a-Move in North America, is a 1994 tile-matching arcade puzzle video game for one or two players created by Taito Corporation.

This allows players to get directly on the inside of some of the games that changed the way America viewed baseball.

The game allows, and sometimes requires, pit stops during which cars can get new tires, fuel, and repairs.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1142985600000,"platforms":[11],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1142985600000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Mar-22","y":2006,"m":3}]},{"id":47365,"name":"NFL Blitz 2003","slug":"nfl-blitz-2003","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nfl-blitz-2003","created_at":1499865898113,"updated_at":1513022983430,"summary":"Football with no rules.","collection":2201,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[4366,23443,10121,812,43399,45216,4590,43705,8845,20254],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536870939,536871049,536872078,536875464,536875494,536875562,536875659,536875749,536876190,536876485,536877432,536877686,536878091,536878092,536878093,536878125,536879121,536879648,536879651,536879653,536879655,536879656,536879657,536879658,536879670,536879874,536880425,536881347,536884207],"category":0,"keywords":[26,27,137,1166,4552,4582,4650,4747,4837,5278,5573,6520,6774,7179,7180,7181,7213,8209,8736,8739,8741,8743,8744,8745,8746,8758,8962,9513,10435,13295],"genres":[14],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ximma0nyhhdk7x4ydaae.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ximma0nyhhdk7x4ydaae","width":640,"height":795},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":47366,"name":"Pro Evolution Soccer 2007","slug":"pro-evolution-soccer-2007","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pro-evolution-soccer-2007","created_at":1499866058111,"updated_at":1501627817661,"summary":"Pro Evolution Soccer 6 (also known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 10 and World Soccer: Winning Eleven X for Xbox 360 in Japan and South Korea, Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 in the United States) is a video game developed and published by Konami. Released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and PC platforms and following on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable afterward, Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is the 6th edition of the Pro Evolution Soccer series for the PlayStation 2, 2nd for the PlayStation Portable and 4th for PC. It is the first game to debut on the Nintendo DS and the Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 version features improved graphics, but retains gameplay similar to the other console versions. The edit mode has been stripped down for the Xbox 360 release, due to time restrictions. The graphics engine on the PC does not utilise the next-gen 360 engine but will again be a direct conversion of the PlayStation 2 engine. \n \nA Bundesliga license was supposed to be a feature of the game but Konami were forced to remove the Bundesliga license, which means the Bundesliga is not present in PES6, not even as a series of unlicensed teams, with the exception of FC Bayern Munich who were fully licensed with the omission of their shirt sponsor T-Home. From then on, no further games featured the Bundesliga, with the participation of German teams restricted to a few of its teams appearing in separate blocks (like the UEFA Champions League teams without their own league).","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1173139200000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1173139200000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Mar-06","y":2007,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fqboqfi0sbkwifphfnv9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fqboqfi0sbkwifphfnv9","width":1530,"height":2148}},{"id":47367,"name":"Sega

It features a partnership with BBC's Top Gear as well as its American counterpart. Jeremy Clarkson, presenter for Top Gear, provides commentary in the game's Autovista mode. Other partnerships include a two-year agreement with the American Le Mans Series (ALMS). Over 500 cars and 26 tracks are included. \n \nThe game received universal acclaim from critics. Aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic report scores of 90.50% and 91 out of 100, respectively. Metacritic also reports eight perfect scores from various media outlets. Critics praised the enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave high marks for the Forza 4 '​s Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was not enough of an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3.

Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed. \n \nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir, stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as Key Largo, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential. \n \nL.A. Noire is notable for using Depth Analysis's newly developed technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly 5 million copies combined. \n \nIn addition to the original full game, L.A. Noire: The Complete Edition for PC will include a multi-use code to access all the previously released downloadable content from the console versions, including the “Nicholson Electroplating” Arson case, the “Reefer Madness” Vice case, “The Consul’s Car” Traffic case, “The Naked City” Vice case and “A Slip of the Tongue” Traffic case.","storyline":"Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps is an LAPD detective thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success.

The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008. \n \nSet during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value. \n \nLeft 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts \u0026 Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009. \n \nThe popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\". Eventually all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 and allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1244764800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1244764800000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Jun-12","y":2009,"m":6}]},{"id":47414,"name":"NBA Baller Beats","slug":"nba-baller-beats","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nba-baller-beats","created_at":1499866813042,"updated_at":1532430889723,"summary":"Real Ball.

Players must deal with the fallout from the devastating attacks on U.S. and British soil in a storyline that picks up where 2009's Modern Warfare 2 left off. The single-player campaign has you battling Russian ultranationalists, led by Vladimir Markov, as members of the U.S. Delta Force and British SAS. You'll battle across war-torn areas of New York City, London, Paris, Mogadishu, Dubai, and other regions as you prepare to end the global threat once and for all. \n \nAs with previous entries in the Call of Duty series, Modern Warfare 3's campaign features a heavily scripted, cinematic experience with Hollywood-style special effects. One new mission, for example, has you involved in underwater travel with a sonar-equipped submersible watercraft. You'll then fight inside an enemy-controlled submarine before guiding an inflatable raft across turbulent waters while a naval battle rages nearby. Other sequences have you firing mounted guns, driving vehicles, and more while explosions light up the landscape. \n \nReturning to the game is the cooperative Spec Ops mode that features a series of standalone missions on different maps. New to Spec Ops is a survival option that has you and either a friend or a computer partner battling waves of enemy forces. Shooting down enemies earns you cash, which can be used to purchase new perks, items, weapons, and other upgrades. You'll also be able to earn bonuses by working together as a team and maintaining kill streaks. \n \nThe heart of the game is once again the 18-player online component, which introduces all-new maps and a variety of enhancements to the format introduced in Modern Warfare 2. Popular features such as kill-streak awards, experience points, weapons-based achievements, and perks return, allowing you to customize your character as you progress. An optional subscription service entitled \"Call of Duty Elite\" will allow players to track detailed statistics such as win-loss records, kill-death ratios, time played, most successful maps, favorite weapons, and much more. \n \nHardened Edition bonus items include a Steelbook case, collectible field journal, special ops juggernaut outfit for your Xbox Live avatar, premium membership to Call of Duty Elite, and special founder status on Call of Duty Elite. Call of Duty Elite's premium membership includes all future downloadable content (DLC) for Modern Warfare 3, of which there are 20 pieces of DLC expected within the first nine months following the game's release.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1323302400000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1323302400000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Dec-08","y":2011,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/igpfvfy5wfr427ihwvmt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"igpfvfy5wfr427ihwvmt","width":1053,"height":1387}},{"id":47426,"name":"Nurarihyon no Mago: Hyakki Ryouran Taisen","slug":"nurarihyon-no-mago-hyakki-ryouran-taisen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nurarihyon-no-mago-hyakki-ryouran-taisen","created_at":1499867045027,"updated_at":1515850848460,"summary":"Japan","popularity":1.0,"games":[56987,70861,80340,80312,65728,64828,19658,79148,68246,65995],"tags":[268435460,536870990,536871019,536875054,536878281],"category":0,"keywords":[78,107,4142,7369],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":1324080000000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1324080000000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Dec-17","y":2011,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jd7rnr7y1nmfhsa6htpn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jd7rnr7y1nmfhsa6htpn","width":270,"height":388}},{"id":47427,"name":"NCAA Basketball 09: March Madness Edition","slug":"ncaa-basketball-09-march-madness-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ncaa-basketball-09-march-madness-edition","created_at":1499867047934,"updated_at":1515750333656,"summary":"An Xbox Live Arcade exclusive that allows those who have not experianced NCAA Basketball 09 to relive the 2009 NCAA Tournament for fee of 1200 Microsoft Points ($15)","collection":3616,"popularity":1.0,"games":[10121,28113,54524,11423,48266,26772,26748,73785,66207,19376],"tags":[268435470,536870970,536872205,536873715,536875046,536875073,536875562,536876362],"category":0,"keywords":[58,1293,2803,4134,4161,4650,5450],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1239408000000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1239408000000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Apr-11","y":2009,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q7haqhjemswg4wyr8asm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q7haqhjemswg4wyr8asm","width":219,"height":262},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":47428,"name":"NBA Unrivaled","slug":"nba-unrivaled","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nba-unrivaled","created_at":1499867050817,"updated_at":1534379153904,"summary":"A downloadable arcade-style basketball game that features real teams and players from the 2009-2010 NBA season.","popularity":1.0,"games":[103218,102122,103275,19922,102805,4650,81145,91918,85884,51060],"tags":[268435470,536870970,536875157,536875615,536875635,536878512,536880841,536888127,536890887,536893674,536893675],"category":0,"keywords":[58,4245,4703,4723,7600,9929,17215,19975,22762,22763],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1260489600000,"platforms":[9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1270080000000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Apr-01","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1277251200000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Jun-23","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1260489600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-11","y":2009,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ypinwxlueawcpp5fjilx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ypinwxlueawcpp5fjilx","width":219,"height":264},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":47429,"name":"Metro: Last Light - Limited Edition","slug":"metro-last-light-limited-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metro-last-light-limited-edition","created_at":1499867054664,"updated_at":1527972594954,"summary":"Metro: Last Light (also known as Metro 2033: A Light of Hope in Russia) is a single-player post-apocalyptic-themed first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2013. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released August 26, 2014. \n \nThe game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books. Previously announced as Metro 2034, the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length. \n \nInitially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012; it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver. \n \nMetro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics).

The games were developed by the same team who are responsible for the Street Fighter III series. \n \nIt was originally released in the arcade in 1998 on the CPS-3 arcade system; this version was known outside Japan as JoJo's Venture. An updated version of the game was released in 1999 as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future (ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 未来への遺産 JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken Mirai e no Isan?), becoming the sixth and last game released for the CPS-3 board. Console ports for the PlayStation and Dreamcast were also released that year. A high-definition version of the game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012.[1] \n \nThe game combines Capcom's trademark anime-inspired graphics, as seen in the Darkstalkers series, with the colorful characters and events of Hirohiko Araki's creation, resulting in a highly stylized and detailed visual style. It also features many of the gameplay mechanics seen on previous Capcom fighting games, such as the use of power gauges for super moves, as well as a brand new Stand Mode, consisting of the series' signature guardian spirits that accompanies almost every character and can be summoned or dismissed at will by the player, resulting in variations in the character's move list and abilities. \n \nOriginal author Hirohiko Araki served as a consultant for the game and created exclusive pieces of artwork for its promotion and packaging; most notably, he developed from scratch a new character design for Midler, since Capcom was interested in using her in the game and she had been only vaguely shown in the original manga.","popularity":1.0,"category":0,"first_release_date":1348272000000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1348272000000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Sep-22","y":2012,"m":9}]},{"id":47434,"name":"Hasbro Family Game Night 3","slug":"hasbro-family-game-night-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hasbro-family-game-night-3","created_at":1499867085203,"updated_at":1534376122037,"summary":"The title was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Wii, and features versions of The Game of Life, Clue, Twister, Mouse Trap, and Yahtzee Hands Down.

Also included is a second DVD that explores the making of Gears of War with lead designer Cliff Bleszinski and his development team. \n \nAnointed by the games media as Microsoft's first \"killer app\" for its Xbox 360, Epic Games' Gears of War is a futuristic third-person shooter emphasizing tactical action over run-and-gun battles. Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat. \n \nSince the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them. \n \nA behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":547,"games":[37605,103298,103281,47626,41258,103301,32902,106304,42992,95340],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1166659200000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1166659200000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Dec-21","y":2006,"m":12}]},{"id":47452,"name":"Diablo III: Reaper of Souls - Ultimate Evil Edition","slug":"diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition","created_at":1499868526176,"updated_at":1535043967394,"summary":"Xbox 360 players can experience the full adventure of Blizzard’s epic action RPG, Diablo III, as the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition includes the expansion pack Reaper of Souls!

Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the Locust during the assault upon Locust territory. The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a \"Horde\" mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as \"chainsaw duels\" and the ability to use downed foes as \"meatshields\" were added to the game. \n \nOn its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies.

Although, you could unlock a special fight against a bull if you beat the game without losing a single round, but who the hell would want to play this game for that long?","collection":3862,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[41828,8564,46779,22418,39530,23113,56987,65832,19333,10039],"tags":[268435460,536870973,536871019,536871213,536871889,536875789,536875870,536876825,536876829,536876996,536878192],"publishers":[2678],"category":0,"keywords":[61,107,301,977,4877,4958,5913,5917,6084,7280],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":758764800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[80,136,79,5,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1510790400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Nov-16","y":2017,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1510790400000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Nov-16","y":2017,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1275955200000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Jun-08","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1291334400000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Dec-03","y":2010,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1293408000000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Dec-27","y":2010,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":788054400000,"region":2,"human":"1994-Dec-22","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":758764800000,"region":2,"human":"1994-Jan-17","y":1994,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":759715200000,"region":2,"human":"1994-Jan-28","y":1994,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":758764800000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Jan-17","y":1994,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":759715200000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Jan-28","y":1994,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":766540800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Apr-17","y":1994,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Fighter's History Dynamite","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vb75tbjgsqmk5sq5i0vj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vb75tbjgsqmk5sq5i0vj","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uye4zujbllgpueozv3ae.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uye4zujbllgpueozv3ae","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gly4gkvvo31jbyzwvlbp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gly4gkvvo31jbyzwvlbp","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ld10hach9g5hkwwaxy1h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ld10hach9g5hkwwaxy1h","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mwxfmcdfx0hlsan88vaf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mwxfmcdfx0hlsan88vaf","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/weiot274wvybw83dzxkz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"weiot274wvybw83dzxkz","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lmrep1zqxuw3d2ekrawj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lmrep1zqxuw3d2ekrawj","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ofes8iook41clavxhyzl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ofes8iook41clavxhyzl","width":304,"height":224}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zetrxccar7yciaa6f8ue.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zetrxccar7yciaa6f8ue","width":600,"height":786}},{"id":47577,"name":"Zupapa!","slug":"zupapa--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zupapa--1","created_at":1499870748510,"updated_at":1509827523194,"summary":"An action puzzle game where you play as a Zupapa, a strange creature that hurls tiny Zupipi characters at your foes.

Its gameplay was similar to SNK's earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat 'em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack \u0026 slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting. \n \nThe game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen.[1] As only the player characters' silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!,[2] the game's perspective may be considered either first-person or third-person.[citation needed] The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator. A sequel of the game entitled Crossed Swords 2 was released in Japan on May 2, 1995 for the Neo-Geo CD, and was one of the few games designed specifically for the Neo-Geo CD, rather than being an arcade port. \n \nCrossed Swords requires correct timing and movement to progress. The basic rule for the game is to defend first before striking. The player wields both a weapon and shield and can strafe, as well as guard the upper or middle part of the body. Two different weapon strikes are available, a regular attack and a thrusting attack. Weapon-based magic can also be used. Multiple paths through the game are available and the player has an option to skip the first and second chapters freely. \n \nIn the enchanted land of Belkana all was well until plagues of creatures started rampaging through. But it didn't stop there, from deep within the mountains of Graisia, the Demon Warlord Nausizz arose and led the attacks wiping out settlement after settlement. However a brave warrior called \"The Knight of the Journey\" came a long way on a quest to stop these monstrosities. After aiding the Poor Village of Dio from the Caterdragon, the knight heads to the Castle Pulista, but as he is briefed by the king of the problems they face, an elite dark knight appears and kidnaps the princess. The knight fights his way through the enemy lands in the Matius Tower, the Gauda Fortress, the Land Battleship and finally passes the Entrance to the Devil World. Along his way, he is helped by loyalties of the kingdom. The knight battles through the Castle Graisia and comes face to face with Nausizz. As a demon with honour, Nausizz is so impressed with the knight's progress, that he has sent the princess back to Pulista. As the knight defeats Nausizz, he transforms into a fiendish demon dragon. The knight slays him and escapes the collapsing castle. Back in Castle Pulista the knight is offered to come and live with the king. Peace can proceed once more in Belkana.","collection":3740,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,47823,36926,12632,36608,16468,55752,59516,19333,10039],"tags":[1,268435464,268435468,536871076,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871301,536872983,536876007,536878598],"category":0,"keywords":[164,226,227,296,389,2071,5095,7686],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,12],"first_release_date":799372800000,"platforms":[136],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":799372800000,"region":5,"human":"1995-May-02","y":1995,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":802051200000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jun-02","y":1995,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ttoeycwdbd31elzm1uhx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ttoeycwdbd31elzm1uhx","width":600,"height":600}},{"id":47589,"name":"Fire Suplex","slug":"fire-suplex","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-suplex","created_at":1499871217236,"updated_at":1509991830497,"summary":"The flames of battle dance in the ring!

It's a maze, of sorts, and it's one hell of an irritating game. In fact, it is one of the most irritating games that most will ever come across. But it does have its charms, namely its offbeat gameplay. \n \nThe graphics are bright and colorful, with a lot of eye candy everywhere. Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be a good thing, as all that coloring and eye candy has been designed specifically to distract you from beating the level. All that glitter is isolated to the areas immediately surrounding the track, and if you look off the beaten path you'll notice that the graphics there are quite sparse and simplistic. \n \nThe sound and music are passable, though not particularly good. The Irritating Maze's songs sound like generic puzzle game music and are generally pretty forgettable, but they do fit the game's mood. You'll hear an announcer's voice at certain points of the game telling you that you've passed a checkpoint or something like that. \n \nThe announcer sounds reasonably excited, though if you listen you can hear a little bit of electronic fuzz distorting the voice clips. One sound clip stands out above the rest though, and that's the electric zap effect that plays when you lose. When this clip is combined with the associated graphics, the effect is literally shocking. \n \nOne of the biggest reasons why the game is so irritating is that you have to control your character's conducting rod with a trackball. For most people, the trackball is not an ideal input device for precise control, especially when put under the stress of time limits. A digital joystick or D-pad would actually allow you to have more precise control, but then having to deal with unfamiliar controls is part of the \"fun.\" \n \nAt first you'll find the innovative gameplay to be a lot of fun, much like Marble Madness. But unlike Marble Madness, The Irritating Maze's gameplay gets old relatively quickly, and you'll find yourself not caring enough to give the level another go. The Irritating Maze is different enough to be entertaining for a couple of minutes but not quite polished enough to be a lot of fun for the long haul. Give it a quarter or two and see how you do.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,60044,14047,26223,27266,56820,19222,41348,8197,25646],"tags":[268435465,536871684,536873787,536881973],"category":0,"keywords":[772,2875,11061],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":875145600000,"platforms":[79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":875145600000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Sep-25","y":1997,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ultra Denryu Iraira Bou","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/da2t8ib7un1x0xajjp83.jpg","cloudinary_id":"da2t8ib7un1x0xajjp83","width":340,"height":368}},{"id":47600,"name":"Shogi no Tatsujin","slug":"shogi-no-tatsujin","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shogi-no-tatsujin","created_at":1499871269153,"updated_at":1515754338142,"summary":"Shogi no Tatsujin is a Japanese style chess game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26223,25222,60044,39257,8197,14047,18167,66661,9760,33603],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536871208,536873787,536876237],"category":0,"keywords":[296,2875,5325],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":814838400000,"platforms":[79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":814838400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Oct-28","y":1995,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Master of Syougi","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n9emrhemkbda0bok9cs7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n9emrhemkbda0bok9cs7","width":655,"height":749}},{"id":47601,"name":"Pocket Tennis","slug":"pocket-tennis","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pocket-tennis","created_at":1499871272563,"updated_at":1513072228945,"summary":"Pocket Tennis a simple tennis game with two play modes: Exhibition and Tournament. \n \nExhibition is a single match against computer or human opponent (requires link cable).

To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called “Sachiko Ever After,” which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end. This does not go as expected. Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary School, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of survival - much less escape - is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them. Having previously gained a considerable fan base when released digitally on the PSP system, this reimagining on the Nintendo 3DS system represents the first time the original cult classic horror title that spawned a new indie sub-genre will see a physical release in North America. Exclusive new features include 3D art stills, Touch Screen menus, four additional Extra Chapters, expanded story scenes, an in-game character encyclopedia, redrawn character sprites, and newly arranged music tracks. This is the definitive version of the classic horror tale that spans over 50 years of tragedy, where player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.","popularity":1.0,"category":0,"themes":[19],"first_release_date":1480118400000,"platforms":[37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1480118400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Nov-26","y":2016,"m":11}]},{"id":47670,"name":"Adventure Time: Finn \u0026 Jake Investigations","slug":"adventure-time-finn-and-jake-investigations--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/adventure-time-finn-and-jake-investigations--1","created_at":1499872648139,"updated_at":1534368760692,"summary":"Adventure Time: Finn and Jake Investigations is an all-new, real-time, fully 3D action-oriented twist on the classic story-driven graphic adventure game.

The game features ten distinct types of challenge for players, all of which are simple to pick up and play using the Nintendo DS stylus, touch screen and microphone. Each of MinDStorm's challenges is designed to focus on enhancing the player's reason, endurance, analysis, intuition or observation. Regardless of the type of game chosen, extended play results in improved overall brain function and enhanced memory. \n \nA first for the brain training genre, MinDStorm throws additional challenges and problems into the mix. Players are rewarded with ever more complex riddles to solve as they do well in the main training mode. General knowledge and geography-based challenges are also included to accompany the more abstract trials such as sliding picture puzzles, mazes to navigate with the stylus and spot the difference games. \n \nFurther innovation is found in the way the game will adapt the tasks it asks players to perform according to the local environment it is being played in. When playing on a bumpy car or train ride for instance, MinDStorm will omit the tasks that require precise stylus action.

It was first released in Japan, and was later released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was originally released in three different versions: Dachshund \u0026 Friends, Lab \u0026 Friends (Shiba \u0026 Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua \u0026 Friends. It has been re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later as Nintendogs: Dalmatian \u0026 Friends. \n \nNintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well as to teach the dog tricks such as \"sit\" or \"roll over\". Players can bring their dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based on the elapsed time. \n \nNintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game Rankings,[3] and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press.

The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked.

After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff \"Crash\" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70.0,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[19934,22690,15851,27081,24198,23733,103020,19448,103281,55092],"tags":[1,268435470,536872078,536872581,536872594,536875046,536875131,536875290,536875300,536875361,536875434,536876348,536876353,536877431,536882429],"publishers":[2103],"category":0,"keywords":[1166,1669,1682,4134,4219,4378,4388,4449,4522,5436,5441,6519,11517],"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":709516800000,"platforms":[41,37,5,18],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":18,"date":725760000000,"region":2,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":709516800000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jun-26","y":1992,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1418256000000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Dec-11","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1417651200000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Dec-04","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1387411200000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Dec-19","y":2013,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1385683200000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Nov-29","y":2013,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1358899200000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Jan-23","y":2013,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1318896000000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Oct-18","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1252886400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Sep-14","y":2009,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":720576000000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Nov-01","y":1992,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Bikkuri Nekketsu Shinkiroku: Harukanaru Kin Medal (JP)","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hkrqicaoht1ocuy8mqlg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hkrqicaoht1ocuy8mqlg","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i4nrlljzqt8ub7avuakt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i4nrlljzqt8ub7avuakt","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rpw0g6ye7zfzpz1op3f1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rpw0g6ye7zfzpz1op3f1","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f7r13yu20frsdtxadi0l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f7r13yu20frsdtxadi0l","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sxb8blmwqpdboblfx4mt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sxb8blmwqpdboblfx4mt","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ocvpaf3s2eoaqzbxlaew.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ocvpaf3s2eoaqzbxlaew","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mgvomcqwzqswmublbe9o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mgvomcqwzqswmublbe9o","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hki4rffjvbxywmfhjeto.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hki4rffjvbxywmfhjeto","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j9efhrdgwbvpuz6dl8x4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j9efhrdgwbvpuz6dl8x4","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/djldtl8ypa9emztoakkc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"djldtl8ypa9emztoakkc","width":400,"height":550},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":48292,"name":"Crackout","slug":"crackout","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crackout","created_at":1499961023685,"updated_at":1515585127751,"summary":"Crackout is a video game that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Konami in 1991.

The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of \"Konami Man\", who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning.

A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year. Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992. Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form. Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players. Enhanced pitch control. Ability to shift field formations when playing defense. Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game. Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired. Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.) Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting. Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each. New music and home run animations. These include the \"Power connect\" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation. Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams. You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5. Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum. You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name. Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders.

It was the eighth best selling Famicom game of 1986, selling 1,250,000 copies.  \n \nThe original Japanese version is notably different from the American version (Ninja Kid). The main character is Kitarō, and his main weapon is his hair rather than darts. His sub-weapons are a flying finger instead of shuriken, his vest instead of the feather, and a geta instead of a boomerang. All of these weapons function the same as the ones of the protagonist of the American version, Kyo; they just use different sprites. The fireball sub-weapon remains the same. Certain levels are inhabited by \"western\" film monsters like Frankenstein's Monster and Count Dracula; the boss of these levels is the character Buckbaird, the leader of the \"western youkai\". The scroll which unlocks the fortress is a crystal ball in the original version. The familiars are also different, being characters from the manga: the Pegasus was originally Nurikabe, the Eagle was Konaki Jiji, and the Mirror was Sunakake Babaa. Finally, a few of the minor enemies are different; most notably the \"Pirate Ninja\" found in some of the Guerilla Warfare levels was originally Nezumi Otoko, and Kitaro rides on Ittan Momen during the Dog Fight levels.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":516672000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":516672000000,"region":8,"human":"1986-May-17","y":1986,"m":5}]},{"id":48318,"name":"Toad's Adventure","slug":"toads-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/toads-adventure","created_at":1499963140563,"updated_at":1499969133083,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":48319,"name":"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier","slug":"star-trek-v-the-final-frontier","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/star-trek-v-the-final-frontier","created_at":1499963142286,"updated_at":1500367166229,"summary":"Sybok; Spock’s former classmate at the Vulcan School of Thought has used his mind-melding powers to cause the settlers on the planet nimbus to join his force.

Everyone has to write a fake answer which should look convincing to others when the time comes. \n2) When everyone has submitted their answer in the next screen you will get all the answers submitted by everyone and the right answer(n+1 answers) but nobody know which answer is correct. Everyone has to select the answer they think is the correct answer. \n3) Once everyone has selected the answer in the next screen it shows you who fooled you, how many people you have fooled etc. \n4) You get 2 points for selecting the correct answer and 1 point for fooling each person. And the scoreboard goes on. \n \nThe fun part is all the politics happen when everyone try to promote their answer by conversation. And the best feel you get when you fool everyone around you. \n \nGood Features: \n1) Facebook integration: It is very easy to invite people in the game as it has store all the friends who are playing the game. \n2) Chat: Game has a pretty smooth chat feature if you are playing from different different locations. \n3) Game Notifications: Whenever one of my friend start playing i get a notification with the name who is playing. It gives me the decision ability to play right at the moment since i know who is playing. And the notification takes me directly to the game. \n \nThings i would love to see: \n1) Voice: If somehow it was possible to do conversation using voice instead of chat it would be so great. \n \nGame Link: https://foolio.app.link","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11588,19083,28213,28113,16309,74498,26848,18387,28465,19082],"tags":[27,34,40,268435480,268435482,268435488],"developers":[13123],"publishers":[13123],"category":0,"game_modes":[2],"themes":[27,34,40],"genres":[24,26,32],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tlvsyyuqgtujfomqjf13.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tlvsyyuqgtujfomqjf13","width":1440,"height":2560},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jdd8bfajiwlt2tprfjf0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jdd8bfajiwlt2tprfjf0","width":1440,"height":2560},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yggzoassiv3elzjrwyhn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yggzoassiv3elzjrwyhn","width":1440,"height":2560},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ddt6lkynajbj5xue6dg4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ddt6lkynajbj5xue6dg4","width":540,"height":960}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rzv9cavfzzsadurki5qc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rzv9cavfzzsadurki5qc","width":1024,"height":500},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paxplay.foolio"},{"category":10,"url":"https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/id1165436383?mt=8"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/twitter.com/paxplay"},{"category":4,"url":"https://facebook.com/paxplay"},{"category":1,"url":"http://paxplay.in"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":39,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"onlinemax":12},{"platform":34,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"onlinemax":12}]},{"id":48337,"name":"Tiger Jenny","slug":"tiger-jenny","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tiger-jenny","created_at":1499963413532,"updated_at":1500370811363,"summary":"Tiger Jenny is a NES game set in the same universe as \"Ittle Dew\" it takes place a thousand years before the events of that game. \nBattle your way through the forests to seek vengeance on the Turnip Witch who dwells in her castle. \n \nNote that this game actually runs on the real hardware, it's not just an imitation. \nTherefore the release is in nes rom format so you'll need an emulator to play it.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1420070400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":1420070400000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jan-01","y":2015,"m":1}]},{"id":48338,"name":"Sir Ababol","slug":"sir-ababol","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sir-ababol","created_at":1499963414748,"updated_at":1500370811703,"summary":"Sir Ababol controlled through the Monegros for all ababoles.

Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional features the likeness of Japan's most prominent golf player, Masashi \"Jumbo\" Ozaki - the Jumbo nickname comes from his unusual height for a Japanese male: almost 6'.

Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have. Failure to hit the swing precisely will lead to slices and hooks. \n \nThe game can be played as a single player Stroke Match, which allows the player to practice on each of the game's 36 holes across two different courses. The player can also play against another human, or rate their score against CPU opponents in the 1 Day and 4 Day modes.

It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game. \n \nThe game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death. \n \nKi has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds. \n \nMany of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chest, which hold various items. Although many of the items bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were found. \n \nAfter completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These stages contain cameos from the Pac-Man ghosts and the enemies from Dig Dug.","collection":3031,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,36926,47823,117,6732,12632,29147,19174,19448,9174],"tags":[1,268435464,268435465,268435468,536870926,536871059,536871123,536871138,536871208,536871865,536872961,536873299,536873787,536874209,536874225,536875057,536875596,536875640,536875665,536875699,536875830,536875837,536876054,536876057,536877724,536877769,536878007,536878356,536878449,536880444,536883059],"category":0,"keywords":[14,147,211,226,296,953,2049,2387,2875,3297,3313,4145,4684,4728,4753,4787,4918,4925,5142,5145,6812,6857,7095,7444,7537,9532,12147],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,9,12],"first_release_date":588211200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":588211200000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Aug-22","y":1988,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Kai no Bouken","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uwoc6nlfteyvbalxrr0u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uwoc6nlfteyvbalxrr0u","width":528,"height":776}},{"id":48354,"name":"Double Action 53 Volume TWO","slug":"double-action-53-volume-two","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/double-action-53-volume-two","created_at":1499963576771,"updated_at":1499968996662,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":48355,"name":"NES Virus Cleaner","slug":"nes-virus-cleaner","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nes-virus-cleaner","created_at":1499963578472,"updated_at":1500370588454,"summary":"NES Virus Cleaner is pretty much a spoof of the NES Cleaning Kit.

Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare. \n \nOnce the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the \"neutral gangs.\" These \"neutral gangs\" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying \"no\" when asked to fight (たたかい?, \"Struggle\"). \n \nNeutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game. \n \nThat means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, \"Not among\") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":680659200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":680659200000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Jul-28","y":1991,"m":7}]},{"id":48385,"name":"Tokoro-san no Mamoru mo Semeru mo","slug":"tokoro-san-no-mamoru-mo-semeru-mo","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tokoro-san-no-mamoru-mo-semeru-mo","created_at":1499965188591,"updated_at":1513005496268,"summary":"An action platformer game by Sony label Sony Epic Records that was only released in Japan on June 27th, 1987.

Besides interrogating people for information, or simply beating them up for train fare, Holmes must search seemingly random cracks or trees in order to find important clues, or inventory items.","collection":3385,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[37088,47823,19289,16468,26848,1221,59516,27314,13189,23175],"tags":[1,17,22,268435487,536871939,536872581,536875054,536875058,536875067,536876208,536877451],"category":0,"keywords":[1027,1669,4142,4146,4155,5296,6539],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":534643200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":534643200000,"region":5,"human":"1986-Dec-11","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":537321600000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Jan-11","y":1987,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e24xokztvfmkcgqqxdlm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e24xokztvfmkcgqqxdlm","width":265,"height":384}},{"id":48397,"name":"Shadow Brain","slug":"shadow-brain","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-brain","created_at":1499965227463,"updated_at":1500370463475,"summary":"Shadow Brain is a Role-Playing game, developed by Scitron \u0026 Art and published by Pony Canyon, which was released in Japan in 1991.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":672192000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":672192000000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Apr-21","y":1991,"m":4}]},{"id":48398,"name":"Seirei Gari","slug":"seirei-gari","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/seirei-gari","created_at":1499965232379,"updated_at":1500370463786,"summary":"Seirei Gari is an Adventure game, developed by Advance Communication Company and published by Hudson, which was released in Japan in 1989.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":631756800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":631756800000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jan-08","y":1990,"m":1}]},{"id":48399,"name":"Seikima II: Akuma no Gyakushuu","slug":"seikima-ii-akuma-no-gyakushuu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/seikima-ii-akuma-no-gyakushuu","created_at":1499965235894,"updated_at":1515711285882,"summary":"Seikima II Akuma no Gyakushū!

Sometimes defeating enemies unlocks new weapons.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55590,19301,9789,11582,18623,23212,19934,25311,9199],"tags":[18,268435469,268435471,536871079,536871882,536872060,536874694,536875160],"category":0,"keywords":[167,970,1148,3782,4248],"themes":[18],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":628473600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":628473600000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Dec-01","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":631152000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jan-01","y":1990,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/avlk9habifurepnlzmae.jpg","cloudinary_id":"avlk9habifurepnlzmae","width":398,"height":568}},{"id":48427,"name":"Mindseeker","slug":"mindseeker","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mindseeker","created_at":1499965482414,"updated_at":1516751737186,"summary":"Mindseeker is an Adventure game, developed and published by Namco, which was released in Japan in 1989.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[27314,26766,19448,25300,36950,13189,17469,25222,25311,41895],"tags":[18,268435487,536871882,536871939,536872124,536878362],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1027,1212,7450],"themes":[18],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":608860800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":608860800000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Apr-18","y":1989,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":611452800000,"region":8,"human":"1989-May-18","y":1989,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cb3juw7meyhfxdr111ot.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cb3juw7meyhfxdr111ot","width":283,"height":409}},{"id":48428,"name":"Metal Max","slug":"metal-max","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-max","created_at":1499965484609,"updated_at":1510654586939,"summary":"Metal Max (メタルマックス Metaru Makkusu?) is a 1991 vehicle combat role-playing video game developed by Crea-Tech and published by Data East for the Nintendo Famicom exclusively in Japan on May 24, 1991 and later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console on April 27, 2010.

The history of humanity ended and dominion of the planet returned to the demons. These mutant creatures did not depend on oxygen to survive. Therefore, they were able to breathe the air and use the land.Meanwhile, an army of robots wage World War IV against the demons in order to conquer what is now known as Makai - the Demon World. These robots came to the planet on a wave of energy that created an explosion that turned the world into a wasteland. Much later in the game, concurrent themes including Adolf Hitler, war, creating a perfect race of people, and the destruction of humanity in the year 1999 are revealed to the player inside one of the robot's main bases. \n \nCan the demons gain dominion on the humans' old planet or will robots enforce impose a millennium of logic and dictatorial force throughout Makai? Playing as the robots is not an option that is open to the player. Therefore, the player must take advantage of his or her mutant army and crush the robot invaders. This game builds on the fear of robot domination of the world that has been featured greatly in movies from The Terminator to Terminator Salvation. The gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy as the turn-based fights are viewed from a third-person perspective.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,11567,18822,1593,25300,23198,21063,7202,36926,11156],"tags":[18,268435468,268435487,536870915,536870931,536870979,536870981,536870999,536871022,536871041,536871088,536871138,536871208,536871327,536871332,536871487,536871501,536871644,536871882,536871904,536871938,536871939,536872019,536872120,536872229,536872232,536872425,536872799,536872862,536873364,536873580,536873774,536873874,536874743,536874994,536875055,536875083,536875137,536875161,536875162,536875184,536875185,536875196,536875197,536875242,536875265,536875310,536875319,536875326,536875380,536875437,536875608,536875671,536875837,536875882,536875888,536875896,536876010,536876054,536876076,536876332,536876391,536876499,536876505,536876619,536876693,536876712,536876857,536876875,536876996,536877000,536877216,536877331,536877532,536877928,536878072,536878267,536878481,536878585,536879070,536880253,536880255,536880286,536880445,536880607,536880667,536880943],"category":0,"keywords":[3,19,67,69,87,110,129,176,226,296,415,420,575,589,732,970,992,1026,1027,1107,1208,1317,1320,1513,1887,1950,2452,2668,2862,2962,3831,4082,4143,4171,4225,4249,4250,4272,4273,4284,4285,4330,4353,4398,4407,4414,4468,4525,4696,4759,4925,4970,4976,4984,5098,5142,5164,5420,5479,5587,5593,5707,5781,5800,5945,5963,6084,6088,6304,6419,6620,7016,7160,7355,7569,7673,8158,9341,9343,9374,9533,9695,9755,10031],"themes":[18],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":660787200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":660787200000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Dec-10","y":1990,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dcgptuhvs18usf3mdxfu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dcgptuhvs18usf3mdxfu","width":640,"height":873}},{"id":48437,"name":"Kyouryuu Sentai Zyuranger","slug":"kyouryuu-sentai-zyuranger","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kyouryuu-sentai-zyuranger","created_at":1499965512383,"updated_at":1517270571387,"summary":"A group of astronauts from Japan accidentally free Bandora and her gang while exploring Nemesis.

The game was only released in Japan. \n \nThe sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character.

Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\". \n \nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications. \n \nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.","collection":4315,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28540,34919,16468,59516,36608,10039,25311,36926,21642,7202],"tags":[1,536870916,536871315,536871506,536872668,536873473,536873671,536874398,536875150,536875204,536875389,536875400,536875420,536875448,536875792,536876057,536876232,536876266,536876455,536878203],"category":0,"keywords":[4,403,594,1756,2561,2759,3486,4238,4292,4477,4488,4508,4536,4880,5145,5320,5354,5543,7291],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":547948800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":547948800000,"region":8,"human":"1987-May-14","y":1987,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xt0xodguyfmbqgocp35f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xt0xodguyfmbqgocp35f","width":288,"height":202}},{"id":48474,"name":"Hi no Tori Hououhen: Gaou no Bouken","slug":"hi-no-tori-hououhen-gaou-no-bouken","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hi-no-tori-hououhen-gaou-no-bouken","created_at":1499965773115,"updated_at":1500370131857,"summary":"As a child, a young boy named Gaou lost an arm and an eye, and as a result, from a young age he was discriminated against and teased, unable to fit in with his peers. The constant ridicule and persecution caused Gaou to become bitter, and hardened, eventually turning to a life as a thief. In spite of his wicked and corrupt lifestyle, Gaou met a woman who saw goodness in him, and the two were married. However, one day, over nothing more than a trifling disagreement, Gaou lost control of himself, and killed his wife. Realization of what he had done caused Gaou to deeply regret his wicked deeds, and reform his behavior. Gaou encountered a Buddhist monk who helped him change his ways, and discover his passion for sculpting. Renouncing his previous life of violence, Gaou became a Buddhist sculptor, devoting himself to the creation of magnificent sculptures renowned for the raw and powerful emotions he was able to invoke in his work. One day, together with a fellow sculptor Akanemaru, Gaou encountered a mythical phoenix, who, according to legend, can bestow eternal life to those who drink its blood. Inspired, Gaou devotes himself to the creation of a magnificent phoenix sculpture. However, shortly after finishing the sculpture, it was stolen from him, broken into 16 pieces, and hidden in different time periods of the past and the future. In order to recover the 16 phoenix sculpture pieces, Gaou embarked on a perilous journey that would take him through space and time.[1]","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":539395200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":539395200000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-04","y":1987,"m":2}]},{"id":48475,"name":"Heracles no Eikou: Toujin Makyouden","slug":"heracles-no-eikou-toujin-makyouden","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/heracles-no-eikou-toujin-makyouden","created_at":1499965775860,"updated_at":1513086817890,"summary":"Heracles no Eikou: Toujin Makyouden is a Role-Playing game, published by Data East, which was released in Japan in 1987.","collection":4898,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,36926,36534,18398,47823,12632,25300,59516,55092,22747],"tags":[268435468,268435487,536870947,536871208,536871938,536871939,536875472],"category":0,"keywords":[35,296,1026,1027,4560],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":553046400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":553046400000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Jul-12","y":1987,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"The Glory of Heracles 1","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oyjps793s4h5nuxojdpc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oyjps793s4h5nuxojdpc","width":290,"height":202}},{"id":48476,"name":"Hana no Star Kaidou","slug":"hana-no-star-kaidou","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hana-no-star-kaidou","created_at":1499965961734,"updated_at":1516739010467,"summary":"Hana no Star Kaidou (which can be loosely translated as \"Blossoming Star Highway\") is an action game for the Famicom that was developed and published by Victor Musical Industries in 1987.

Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller. \n \nGegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points. \n \nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.","collection":3720,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[7329,12632,51464,13189,26914,19567,25646,44076,47158,16309],"tags":[19,27,268435468,536870990,536871262,536871938,536872032,536873476,536875053,536875472],"category":0,"keywords":[78,350,1026,1120,2564,4141,4560],"themes":[19,27],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":567129600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":567129600000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Dec-22","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":569808000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-22","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lipqn8udnmlqfulywqoz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lipqn8udnmlqfulywqoz","width":299,"height":210}},{"id":48486,"name":"Garfield no Isshukan: A Week of Garfield","slug":"garfield-no-isshukan-a-week-of-garfield","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/garfield-no-isshukan-a-week-of-garfield","created_at":1499965995461,"updated_at":1500370135594,"summary":"A Week of Garfield (ガーフィールドの一週間 Gāfirudo no Isshukan?) is a 1989 Family Computer title based on the comic character Garfield.

The player takes the role of a young soldier who was stationed with the Rayieza unit on the planet Mars. The journey begins as he makes his way back to Earth along with the other members of his unit.","collection":3644,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,19301,25300,25311,26145,23212,1595,29147,8773,9789],"tags":[18,268435468,268435469,536870915,536870990,536871079,536871859,536871882,536871938,536871970,536872060,536872124,536872651,536875196,536875573,536876028,536876258,536876522,536877744,536879912],"category":0,"keywords":[3,78,167,947,970,1026,1058,1148,1212,1739,4284,4661,5116,5346,5610,6832,9000],"themes":[18],"genres":[12,13],"first_release_date":569203200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":569203200000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-15","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fh6bxmwajmqbqdjg7c0q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fh6bxmwajmqbqdjg7c0q","width":803,"height":1200}},{"id":48504,"name":"Exciting Boxing","slug":"exciting-boxing","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/exciting-boxing","created_at":1499966170027,"updated_at":1516759792945,"summary":"Exciting Boxing is a Sports game, developed by Human Entertainment and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.","collection":3782,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[58599,56529,49180,13456,13430,12980,9151,46820,102134,80919],"tags":[268435470,536871544],"category":0,"keywords":[632],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":569289600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":569289600000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-16","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qxljfnrhcmldfvxutgue.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qxljfnrhcmldfvxutgue","width":442,"height":221}},{"id":48505,"name":"Esper Dream 2: Aratanaru Tatakai","slug":"esper-dream-2-aratanaru-tatakai","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/esper-dream-2-aratanaru-tatakai","created_at":1499966173629,"updated_at":1500370047779,"summary":"Esper Dream 2: Aratanaru Tatakai is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1992.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":712108800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":712108800000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jul-26","y":1992,"m":7}]},{"id":48506,"name":"Esper Boukentai","slug":"esper-boukentai","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/esper-boukentai","created_at":1499966175841,"updated_at":1516761714986,"summary":"Esper Boukentai is a platform action game developed by Jaleco for the Famicom and published in 1987.

All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.","collection":3383,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,36926,12632,36534,18398,19698,47823,17583,25300,55092],"tags":[268435468,536871208,536871501,536871599,536871938,536872425,536875075,536875242,536875472,536875735,536877554],"category":0,"keywords":[296,589,687,1026,1513,4163,4330,4560,4823,6642],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":579484800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":579484800000,"region":5,"human":"1988-May-13","y":1988,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":582163200000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jun-13","y":1988,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Deep Dungeon 3","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dsfamcuopteb3edrh0uw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dsfamcuopteb3edrh0uw","width":579,"height":800}},{"id":48515,"name":"De-Block","slug":"de-block","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/de-block","created_at":1499966586668,"updated_at":1513145847144,"summary":"De-Block is a Puzzle game, published by Athena, which was released in Japan in 1991.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[60044,25222,14047,19222,41348,26223,10225,27266,83207,83155],"tags":[268435465,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[2875],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":684374400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":684374400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Sep-09","y":1991,"m":9}]},{"id":48516,"name":"Ultraman Club: Supokon Fight!","slug":"ultraman-club-supokon-fight","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ultraman-club-supokon-fight","created_at":1499966589428,"updated_at":1500370052737,"summary":"Ultraman Club: Supokon Fight! is a Sports game, developed by TOSE and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1993.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":738115200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":738115200000,"region":8,"human":"1993-May-23","y":1993,"m":5}]},{"id":48517,"name":"Yuu Yuu Hakusho: Bakutou Ankoku Bujutsu Kai","slug":"yuu-yuu-hakusho-bakutou-ankoku-bujutsu-kai","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yuu-yuu-hakusho-bakutou-ankoku-bujutsu-kai","created_at":1499966592285,"updated_at":1515840157167,"summary":"Yuu Yuu Hakusho: Bakutou Ankoku Bujutsu Kai is an Action game, developed by TOSE and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1993.","collection":3874,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19658,10039,56987,28010,1235,41828,51464,22418,12632,27209],"tags":[1,268435460,536870990,536871019,536875054,536877029],"category":0,"keywords":[78,107,4142,6117],"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":753926400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":753926400000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Nov-22","y":1993,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mby1e8iz7uampvqyoask.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mby1e8iz7uampvqyoask","width":384,"height":452}},{"id":48518,"name":"SD Gundam: Gundam Wars","slug":"sd-gundam-gundam-wars","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sd-gundam-gundam-wars","created_at":1499966596409,"updated_at":1515817644773,"summary":"SD Gundam: Gundam Wars is a Role-Playing game, developed by TOSE and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 1993.","collection":3257,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19301,25311,26766,11582,25300,51464,18811,41052,9789,19099],"tags":[18,268435468,268435471,536870990,536871882,536874694,536875053,536875054],"category":0,"keywords":[78,970,3782,4141,4142],"themes":[18],"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":738115200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":738115200000,"region":8,"human":"1993-May-23","y":1993,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/arkan6ticpra3scopnop.jpg","cloudinary_id":"arkan6ticpra3scopnop","width":226,"height":335}},{"id":48519,"name":"J.

All upgrades are visual only meaning they don't enhance the strength of the heroes and have a minimum rating requirement so their purpose is to show off your achievements. \n \nThe game has a lot of interesting mechanics and it's built so the more you play it, the more you can improve your strategies. Each hero is equipped with 4 unique abilities that provide an advantage when they're used, but an even larger one if they're used at the right time. 3 of the abilities are cool-down based meaning they can be used every so often while the 4th ability which is the strongest for each hero, charges over time based on the damage and healing each hero does. To do well in the game, players need to pay attention to what abilities they have available, when to use them, how to synchronize and match different abilities for a better outcome and last but not least, pay attention to the position on the map for each hero.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"tags":[1073741826],"developers":[13124],"game_engines":[404],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[546,1247],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1491696000000,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1492041600000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Apr-13","y":2017,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1491696000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Apr-09","y":2017,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ow6swdgvmrtua3ulnccw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ow6swdgvmrtua3ulnccw","width":2560,"height":1440}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"JLIBHPYdA7Q"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/phax5wmevjafp4xnumya.jpg","cloudinary_id":"phax5wmevjafp4xnumya","width":2560,"height":1440},"esrb":{"rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pulciu.tomeofheroes"},{"category":10,"url":"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1227062768\u0026mt=8"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy_91N6eGpkXsJUUI-ybWPg"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/tomeofheroes"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/TomeOfHeroes"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.tomeofheroes.com"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":39,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":2,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":34,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":2,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":48676,"name":"Super Lode Runner II","slug":"super-lode-runner-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-lode-runner-ii","created_at":1499967706692,"updated_at":1516762551924,"summary":"The second compilation of levels from Irem's Lode Runner Arcade series.

Raichi announces that it is time to destroy Earth and eradicate the remaining Saiyans. \n \nSoon Mr. Popo arrives at the Son household to speak with Goku and Gohan, he tells them that Dende sent him to tell them that mysterious machines have appeared all over the planet, and they are releasing gas which kills everything around it - plants, animals, and people. Goku and Gohan head off to stop the threat, first stopping at Capsule Corp to talk with Bulma and her father, but Bulma reveals that she is unable to do anything to stop the machines. Mr. Popo then tells Goku and Gohan the location of the machines: Grand Apollon, Western Desert, Bunbuku Island, and the Land of Ice. Piccolo then arrives, stating that he also wishes to help stop this menace, Goku suggests they split up and all go after one machine, and the three Z Fighters each choose an area to head to: Goku will go to Grand Apollon, Gohan will go to the Western Desert, and Piccolo will head to Bunbuku Island. However, two monsters show up (Arbee and Kinkarn) and attack the Z Fighters. Goku attacks them with a Kamehameha, but discovers that the Destron Gas is affecting him and the others, causing them to be unable to properly use their ki attacks. Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo fight the monsters in hand-to-hand combat and defeat them. The three then head to each of their chosen areas. \n \nGoku arrives in Grand Apollon and begins searching for the location of the Destron Gas Machine. Goku goes to the nearby town and asks around if anyone knows about the machine; nobody knows anything but say that there have been strange lights in the west. Goku heads to a large rock formation in the southwest and finds a bird egg, which soon hatches, the bird flies off and Goku follows it, eventually the two arrive at a nest area. The bird tells Goku that it had heard several things while staying on the rock and that there is a machine inside it guarded by another monster, so Goku heads back to the rock, enters and finds the Destron Gas Unit and its guard Ponkarn, Goku fights and defeats Ponkarn and then destroys the Destron Gas Machine. \n \nGohan arrives at the Western Desert and heads to the local town in order to get information on the Destron Gas Machine; the locals tell Gohan of a pyramid to the south, so Gohan heads there but finds it is too dark to see, so he heads back to the town and is given a flashlight by a man. Gohan heads into the pyramid and finds an inscription stating that there is an even larger pyramid buried under the sand in the southeast. Gohan heads southeast and finds a large sand dune, he inspects it and eventually finds the entrance to the pyramid. Gohan travels through the pyramid and eventually finds a mummy, who requests that Gohan help it unwrap, Gohan manages to unwrap the mummy and discovers that it is in fact a young girl. The girl reveals that she discovered the Destron Gas machine but was wrapped up by the monster guarding it and left trapped in the pyramid. The girl leads Gohan to he machine, where he confronts and defeats its guardian - Jiku - and then destroys it. \n \nPiccolo arrives at Bunbuku Island, but has no idea where to look for the machine and so heads to the nearby town, but they don't know anything so Piccolo heads to several landmarks, including Pilaf's Castle, a large rock area, a lake with a hole in the ground, and Poco Poco Volcano. Piccolo finds nothing at any location until he arrives at the lake, where he meets a pink monster called Kawazu, Piccolo threatens it into revealing the location of the Destron Gas Unit; it obliges, revealing that the machine is beneath the Poco Poco Volcano. Piccolo heads to the volcano but finds that it is too hot to enter, so he decides to head back to Capsule Corp for help from Bulma. Bulma agrees to help, but only if Piccolo helps her with destroying some walls, he does so and she gives him a capsule full of snow to use to cool down the volcano. Piccolo heads back to the volcano and uses the capsule to cool it down, he then heads down and discovers the machine and its guard, who happens to be Kawazu, who he threatened earlier. Piccolo defeats the monster and destroys the machine. \n \nFuture Trunks arrives at Capsule Corp looking for Bulma, but cannot find he, Dr. Brief tells him that she is missing but he thinks she will come back. Future Trunks heads off to look for her at Bunbuku Island; he visits each of the islands locations but cannot locate his mother. When he heads to the Eastern Coast and discovers two monsters, he asks where Bulma is and they reveal that she has been taken to an island off the coast in the east; Future Trunks fights and defeats the two monsters and then heads to the island. He finds Bulma and also his baby present counterpart held hostage by more monsters, Future Trunks prepares to fight them, and Vegeta shows up to help him, the two defeat the monsters and then the group head back to Capsule Corp. \n \nGoku and Gohan meet in the Land of Ice, and though Piccolo has not yet arrived, they decide to head out to look for the last machine. They go to a giant control tower in the east and upon arriving are joined by Piccolo. They find the guard who reveals that the last machine is not in the tower, and that the instructions for the machine have already been sent from the tower. The group head to talk to Bulma and then return to the Land of Ice, where they are attacked by an army of monsters; they defeat the monsters and follow their leader southwest to a large rock. Vegeta and Future Trunks arrive, the group then destroy the machine, but it explodes and damages all of them; another army of the monsters (comprised of Gure, Skud, and Bude) attacks the Z Fighters but is eventually defeated. The group are then contacted by Dende, who tells them to head back to West City, as something strange is happening at the television station. \n \nUpon arriving at West City, Bulma tells the Z Fighters that they must head straight to the television station, which is dark aside from four spotlights, revealing four figures: Frieza, Cooler, Slug, and Turles. After the Z Fighters and their past enemies finish talking, they head to a deserted area of the world to fight. First Slug and Turles battle the Z Fighters, only to be defeated, so Frieza and Cooler engage the heroes, only to also be defeated. The villains regenerate and begin the fight again, Turles and Slug attack together, and are defeated, and then Frieza and Cooler attack and are beaten. King Kai then contacts Goku and tells him how to properly defeat the evil warriors. Turles, Slug, Cooler, and Frieza all attack together again and are defeated, but before the group is able to finish them off Frieza launches a huge blast and destroys Bunbuku Island, killing all of the island's inhabitants. The Z Fighters then decide to head offto collect the Dragon Balls in order to bring back Bunbuku Island and its inhabitants, and then head to space to defeat the threat once and for all. Bulma says that to make a space ship for them, she needs some special alien crystals, but they were located on Bunbuku Island, so the Z Fighters are given the Dragon Radar by Bulma, and head off to collect the Dragon Balls. \n \nThe Z Fighters head around the world and collect four Dragon Balls, then get the fifth from Krillin, they then head back to West City and find Emperor Pilaf, Pilaf reveals the locations of his two collected Dragon Balls and the Z Fighters collect them. The Z Fighters return to Pilaf and they wish for Bunbuku Island to return, they then collect the crystals and head back to Bulma, who builds a ship for them. The Z Fighters then head to space. \n \nThe Z Fighters head to the Dark Planet, but find that it is surrounded by a force field; the ship is damaged by the shield and it crash lands on desert planet. The Z Fighters head to the nearest town and are told by the inhabitants that their elder is in a giant tower that is in the southwest. The elder says that he will help repair the ship if they collect an ancient ring for him. The ring is located in a tomb on the planet and so the group head to it, enter it and begin searching for the ring; they find it in a pyramid inside the tomb, but Frieza is guarding it. The Z Fighters fight and defeat Frieza and then take the ring. The Z Fighters give the ring to the elder, who then helps them repair the ship. The group then head into space again, and contact Bulma to tell her what has happened. The group then spot another ship and decide to follow it to see if the crew know how to get into the Dark Planet. \n \nThe Z Fighters arrive at the planet where the ship they were following has landed, it is a planet of water. After they help it, the alien in the ship gives them a device which can help them get onto the Dark Planet. The group then head back to the desert planet for information on the item and are told that it will allow them to travel beneath the sea to a hidden city. The Z Fighters then head back to the fire planet and go to the underwater city.

Imitation of the Four Heavenly Kings Star\") is a Nintendo Family Computer life simulation video game that portrays the life of either a musician or a famous performer of the monomane (模倣?, \"imitation\") style of Japanese theatre. The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert. \n \nAppeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues. \n \nIn the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert. \n \nWhen the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects. \n \nThe dice combination \"A-1\" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an \"F-5\" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player. Guessing about the result of the dice throw is all the fun of trying to get popularity for the band and greater appreciation from different age groups.","popularity":1.0,"games":[44242,24491,28465,75579,75275,34919,75102,33603,36962,55888],"tags":[268435469],"category":0,"genres":[13],"first_release_date":655862400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":655862400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Oct-14","y":1990,"m":10}]},{"id":48730,"name":"Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In","slug":"baken-hisshou-gaku-gate-in","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/baken-hisshou-gaku-gate-in","created_at":1499970793750,"updated_at":1500373988304,"summary":"Baken Hisshou Gaku: Gate In is a Sports game, developed by Graphic Research and published by K Amusement Leasing, which was released in Japan in 1990.","popularity":1.0,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":646272000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":646272000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jun-25","y":1990,"m":6}]},{"id":48731,"name":"Lawn Mower","slug":"lawn-mower","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lawn-mower","created_at":1499970796237,"updated_at":1512988275249,"summary":"The goal of this game is to mow all the grass before you run out of gas.

Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!? is a shogi game that uses the gunjin shogi, or military shogi, variant of the classic eastern chess-like board game. The player starts by selecting one of five opponents: A pumpkin-headed ghost, a werewolf Al Capone, an alien, Adolf Hitler or a sumo wrestler. The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player. The player must use their wits to defeat the enemy's force of shogi pieces, which have different themes depending on the opponent the player has chosen (for instance, when fighting the pumpkin ghost both sides have vegetable-themed pieces). \n \nWhen one of the player's pieces and an opponent's piece occupy the same space, a battle ensues: Some pieces will always win against other types, sort of like the rock-paper-scissors aspect of strategy games like Fire Emblem. If neither of the two pieces are weak to the other, both are eliminated. The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off. \n \nThe game, like all shogi simulators, was never released outside of Japan.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11588,19083,28213,19082,7782,11529,25217,28751,65832,15894],"tags":[27,268435471,268435482,536870913,536870915,536871262,536871578,536872733,536873513,536875051,536875171],"category":0,"keywords":[1,3,350,666,1821,2601,4139,4259],"themes":[27],"genres":[15,26],"first_release_date":612144000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":612144000000,"region":5,"human":"1989-May-26","y":1989,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":614822400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Jun-26","y":1989,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f8rdb1urajoly4nutmpb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f8rdb1urajoly4nutmpb","width":300,"height":203}},{"id":48750,"name":"Kabushiki Doujou: The Stock Speculation","slug":"kabushiki-doujou-the-stock-speculation","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kabushiki-doujou-the-stock-speculation","created_at":1499971041080,"updated_at":1516751211166,"summary":"A stock market simulation game from Hect for the NES.

Baseball specifically favored more realistic looking athlete sprites while Family Stadium would persist with the cartoonish \"super deformed\" sprites.","collection":3166,"popularity":1.0,"games":[48304,83137,48847,48309,42558,37872,37833,80390,46605,37836],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536875141,536875570],"category":0,"keywords":[20,4229,4658],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":567129600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":567129600000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Dec-22","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":569808000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-22","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kkdooslw6ngurje9cdqd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kkdooslw6ngurje9cdqd","width":320,"height":461}},{"id":48828,"name":"President no Sentaku","slug":"president-no-sentaku","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/president-no-sentaku","created_at":1499971910829,"updated_at":1500374251120,"summary":"President no Sentaku is a Strategy game, developed by Another and published by Hot-B, which was released in Japan in 1990.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":639014400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":639014400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Apr-02","y":1990,"m":4}]},{"id":48829,"name":"Plasma Ball","slug":"plasma-ball","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/plasma-ball","created_at":1499971914925,"updated_at":1500374251443,"summary":"Plasma Ball is an Action game, developed and published by Jaleco Entertainment, which was released in Japan in 1992.","popularity":1.0,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":704332800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":704332800000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Apr-27","y":1992,"m":4}]},{"id":48830,"name":"Pescatore","slug":"pescatore","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pescatore","created_at":1499971917374,"updated_at":1500374251826,"summary":"Pescatore is a Puzzle game, developed by Tierheit and published by SunSoft, which was cancelled before it was released.","popularity":1.0,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9]},{"id":48831,"name":"Peepar Time","slug":"peepar-time","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/peepar-time","created_at":1499971921936,"updated_at":1500374252078,"summary":"Peepar Time is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Sanritsu Denki, which was released in Japan in 1990.","popularity":1.0,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":652924800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":652924800000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Sep-10","y":1990,"m":9}]},{"id":48832,"name":"Paris-Dakar Rally Special!","slug":"paris-dakar-rally-special","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/paris-dakar-rally-special","created_at":1499971976380,"updated_at":1516759286880,"summary":"A NES game based on the famed Paris-Dakar Rally, developed by ISCO. While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level. \n \nParis-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing. \n \nDeveloped by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary \"kusoge\" (crap game). \n \nStage 1 - Preparation \nIn the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally. \n \nStage 2 - First Day \nThe first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage. \n \nStage 3 - Second Day \nThis mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them. \n \nStage 4 - Third Day \nThe action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue. \n \nStage 5 - Fourth Day \nAs the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks. \n \nStage 6 - Fifth Day \nInto the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts. \n \nStage 7 - Sixth Day \nAt some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line. \n \nStage 8 - Final Day \nThe Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,19289,27314,51485,19448,26848,26914,21063,36868,13189],"tags":[1,268435464,268435466,268435487,536870937,536870940,536871078,536871240,536871939,536871971,536872140,536872407,536872668,536872695,536872961,536874539,536875069,536875147,536875150,536875258,536875879,536876540,536878217],"category":0,"keywords":[25,28,166,328,1027,1059,1228,1495,1756,1783,2049,3627,4157,4235,4238,4346,4967,5628,7305],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,10,31],"first_release_date":573177600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":573177600000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Mar-01","y":1988,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dvfvzrjnzwgmo4nmccyr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvfvzrjnzwgmo4nmccyr","width":312,"height":207}},{"id":48833,"name":"Pachiokun 5","slug":"pachiokun-5","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pachiokun-5","created_at":1499971977758,"updated_at":1516654394168,"summary":"The final Famicom Pachio-kun game. \n \nPachio-kun 5 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Color Dreams and published by Coconuts Japan, which was released in Japan in 1993.","collection":3763,"popularity":1.0,"games":[48835,26766,48834,27266,43130,23175,28277,59513,59512,59516],"tags":[268435487,536871641,536871710,536872673,536872983],"category":0,"keywords":[729,798,1761,2071],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":740361600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":740361600000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Jun-18","y":1993,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":742953600000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Jul-18","y":1993,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aul7ghpvkdi8abwsxyhk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aul7ghpvkdi8abwsxyhk","width":300,"height":206}},{"id":48834,"name":"Pachiokun 4","slug":"pachiokun-4","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pachiokun-4","created_at":1499971980534,"updated_at":1516654403722,"summary":"Pachio-kun returns for a fourth outing on the Famicom. \n \nPachio-kun 4 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Color Dreams and published by Coconuts Japan, which was released in Japan in 1991.","collection":3763,"popularity":1.0,"games":[26766,59513,59512,48835,48833,59520,59511,59510,59508,27266],"tags":[268435487,536871641,536871710,536872673,536872983,536875697],"category":0,"keywords":[729,798,1761,2071,4785],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":690768000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":690768000000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Nov-22","y":1991,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":693360000000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Dec-22","y":1991,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hspsyhqqeeppphsnzzkp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hspsyhqqeeppphsnzzkp","width":600,"height":408}},{"id":48835,"name":"Pachiokun 3","slug":"pachiokun-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pachiokun-3","created_at":1499971982255,"updated_at":1516654413042,"summary":"The third Famicom entry in the Pachio-kun series. \n \nPachio-kun 3 is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Color Dreams and published by Coconuts Japan, which was released in Japan in 1990.","collection":3763,"popularity":1.0,"games":[48833,26766,48834,27266,43130,23175,28277,59513,59512,59516],"tags":[268435487,536871641,536871710,536872673,536872983],"category":0,"keywords":[729,798,1761,2071],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":656899200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":656899200000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Oct-26","y":1990,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":659577600000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Nov-26","y":1990,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ckda5l51lvbgyocbrc7j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ckda5l51lvbgyocbrc7j","width":411,"height":282}},{"id":48836,"name":"Pachiokun 2","slug":"pachiokun-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pachiokun-2","created_at":1499971985016,"updated_at":1516753105608,"summary":"The second NES Pachio-kun game, about a sentient pachinko ball that loves playing pachinko.

There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring, but one will start after one enters. \n[edit]Wrestlers \n \nThese wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars of the WCW as of 1993.
