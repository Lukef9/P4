He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan. \n \nThe Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.","collection":4049,"popularity":1.0,"games":[34919,36608,16468,51464,23175,59516,28029,55289,10039,40524],"tags":[1,536871213,536875054,536875065,536875162,536875358,536876208,536879049],"category":0,"keywords":[301,4142,4153,4250,4446,5296,8137],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":754704000000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":754704000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Dec-01","y":1993,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mcdccobg0umfr7uxu5ae.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mcdccobg0umfr7uxu5ae","width":200,"height":197}},{"id":48966,"name":"Ninja Boy 2","slug":"ninja-boy-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ninja-boy-2","created_at":1499973930625,"updated_at":1515839147279,"summary":"Ninja Boy 2 is an Action game, developed and published by Culture Brain, which was released in Japan in 1991.","collection":2530,"popularity":1.0,"games":[36950,25300,68287,71455,26766,28029,64204,27314,25311,19448],"tags":[1,18,536870973,536871882,536871938],"category":0,"keywords":[61,970,1026],"themes":[1,18],"first_release_date":736214400000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":736214400000,"region":8,"human":"1993-May-01","y":1993,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super Chinese Land 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dbsbv8xcpidd1xxlokw1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dbsbv8xcpidd1xxlokw1","width":350,"height":352}},{"id":48967,"name":"Ninja Boy","slug":"ninja-boy","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ninja-boy","created_at":1499973934444,"updated_at":1516746644729,"summary":"Ninja Boy is an Action game, developed and published by Culture Brain, which was released in Japan in 1990","collection":2530,"popularity":1.0,"games":[36608,34919,40524,23175,16468,1070,2940,68324,41828,28029],"tags":[1,536870973],"category":0,"keywords":[61],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":659923200000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":659923200000,"region":2,"human":"1990-Nov-30","y":1990,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":660009600000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Dec-01","y":1990,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super Chinese Land","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r0oosaqcy3c1outsodyc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r0oosaqcy3c1outsodyc","width":300,"height":349}},{"id":48968,"name":"Knight Quest","slug":"knight-quest","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/knight-quest","created_at":1499973938774,"updated_at":1513086823138,"summary":"Sir Will accepts a series of bold quests to defend his land.

You are chased by robots (cyborgs) that end your character's life if they catch him, though you can stand on their heads. Your main weapon is the ability to dig both to the left and right of your character. The holes you dig are only temporary and fill themselves in. A robot that falls into one of your holes will be destroyed if the hole fills in before it can escape. Your character can also suffer this same fate, ending his life. Destroyed robots are replaced with new ones that appear from the top of the screen. The robots can also carry gold which they drop if they fall into a hole. The robot's movements are dependent on yours, and a significant facet of the game play is figuring out how to use the robot's movements to your advantage in clearing a stage. Besides bricks and ladders, levels also consist of blocks (which can't be dug into), rope (to traverse platform chasms) and crumbling bricks (which you fall through). Once all gold has been retrieved a missing segment of ladder will appear allowing your character to escape to the next level.

While there is a released Pinocchio game for the Game Boy mono, “Adventures of…” is a completely different title and Bit Managers never listed this one on their homepage, only Ottifanten. A playable version of this beta was leaked online, and it’s often confused for an official released game. Trying out the game shows that you cannot lose any lives – the counter won’t work. This is no final release and there is none because it’s an unreleased game. \n \nAs we can read in a Wikipedia entry, the game relies on 115 separate levels of puzzle action, played by viewing the playing field in isometric projection. Pinocchio’s main objective is to get to the arrow (the exit) on the screen in order to move onto the next level. If the player is able to navigate Pinocchio to the objective before the timer runs out, he gets a certain number of points equal to the time left. Once this number reaches 500, the Fairy will bestow Pinocchio with an extra life. \n \nA closer look at the dump floating around will reveal a weird internal name “Infrey Quest”, so we can speculate that before Pinocchio and Ottifanten, Bit Managers tried to develop their own original IP. When they did not find any publisher interested in Infrey Quest, they changed the game in Pinocchio and later into Ottifanten, with their more recognized characters. \n \nOttifanten uses the same game concept as well and the same music as Adventure of Pinocchio.

Once he takes enough hits to lose all his HP, he is out of the match. \n \nThe game also adds an RPG element in the ability to gain experience at the end of a match, win or lose, which can then be used to power up stats of your team's players.","collection":3072,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,11253,25300,36950,12632,55752,27209,11567,36926,68287],"tags":[1,18,268435470,536870926,536870990,536871079,536871208,536871587,536871882,536871938,536871987,536872078,536873299,536875054,536875073,536875289,536875348,536875595,536879218,536881795,536882301],"category":0,"keywords":[14,78,167,296,675,970,1026,1075,1166,2387,4142,4161,4377,4436,4683,8306,10883,11389],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":721872000000,"platforms":[38,33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1361836800000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Feb-26","y":2013,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":721872000000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Nov-16","y":1992,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Battle Dodgeball","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xzu7apciiffq9ujo5pfu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xzu7apciiffq9ujo5pfu","width":291,"height":500}},{"id":49149,"name":"3 Choume no Tama: Tama and Friends - 3 Choume Obake Panic!!","slug":"3-choume-no-tama-tama-and-friends-3-choume-obake-panic","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/3-choume-no-tama-tama-and-friends-3-choume-obake-panic","created_at":1500018061703,"updated_at":1500018081116,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":49150,"name":"Ayakashi no Shiro","slug":"ayakashi-no-shiro","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ayakashi-no-shiro","created_at":1500018063900,"updated_at":1500374641225,"summary":"Ayakashi no Shiro is a Role-Playing game, published by Seta Corporation, which was released in Japan in 1990.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":646272000000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":646272000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jun-25","y":1990,"m":6}]},{"id":49151,"name":"Daiku no Gen-san: Robot Teikoku no Yabou","slug":"daiku-no-gen-san-robot-teikoku-no-yabou","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/daiku-no-gen-san-robot-teikoku-no-yabou","created_at":1500018066082,"updated_at":1500018080445,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":49152,"name":"Penguin Land","slug":"penguin-land","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/penguin-land","created_at":1500018067440,"updated_at":1515646400546,"summary":"Penguin Land, known as Doki Doki Penguin Land Uchū Daibōken (どきどきペンギンランド宇宙大冒険? lit. \"Thump Thump Penguin Land: Great Outer Space Adventure\") in Japan, is a Sega Master System game and the second game in the Doki Doki Penguin Land series.

As the headlining act, Aero will walk tightropes, swing on trapezes, blast out of cannons and plunge off the high dive in order to find Ektor and put a stop to his evil plans. \nGreat graphics and action-puzzle elements garnered Aero the Acrobat great reviews when it was first released in 1993. Now you can re-live the classic on Game Boy Advance.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"publishers":[251],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1043971200000,"platforms":[24,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1279843200000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Jul-23","y":2010,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1280102400000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Jul-26","y":2010,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1043971200000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Jan-31","y":2003,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eh7gou1vvrmwffadyxxi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eh7gou1vvrmwffadyxxi","width":249,"height":222},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dbfdk5tddhl8gstshfbf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dbfdk5tddhl8gstshfbf","width":249,"height":222},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v6ws6mkunryeu3ck2akc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v6ws6mkunryeu3ck2akc","width":249,"height":222},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xc9qhrizxmnn70vetbyi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xc9qhrizxmnn70vetbyi","width":249,"height":222}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/no3ajgo72qlcedrw2syk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"no3ajgo72qlcedrw2syk","width":391,"height":266}},{"id":49257,"name":"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron","slug":"spirit-stallion-of-the-cimarron","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/spirit-stallion-of-the-cimarron","created_at":1500019373566,"updated_at":1515656276052,"summary":"Based on the film of the same name, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron tells the tale of a rambunctious mustang stallion named Spirit and his journey through the untamed American West.

The game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex. \n \nGameplay \nIn Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game. \n \nOnce you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green. \n \nAfter you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given access to the title's endless mode. In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game's main mode. After doing this the credits will be available on the game's main screen.","popularity":1.0,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1155427200000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1155427200000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Aug-13","y":2006,"m":8}]},{"id":49485,"name":"BB Ball","slug":"bb-ball","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bb-ball","created_at":1500022229130,"updated_at":1500377620974,"summary":"BB Ball is a Sports game, developed and published by Micott \u0026 Basara, which was released in Japan in 2004.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1090627200000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1090627200000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Jul-24","y":2004,"m":7}]},{"id":49486,"name":"Battle x Battle: Kyoudai Uo Densetsu","slug":"battle-x-battle-kyoudai-uo-densetsu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battle-x-battle-kyoudai-uo-densetsu","created_at":1500022230765,"updated_at":1500377621195,"summary":"Battle x Battle: Kyoudai Uo Densetsu is a Sports game, published by Starfish, which was released in Japan in 2003.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1067126400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1067126400000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Oct-26","y":2003,"m":10}]},{"id":49487,"name":"Bass Tsuri Shiyouze!: Tournament wa Senryaku da!","slug":"bass-tsuri-shiyouze-tournament-wa-senryaku-da","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bass-tsuri-shiyouze-tournament-wa-senryaku-da","created_at":1500022232432,"updated_at":1500377621579,"summary":"Bass Tsuri Shiyouze!: Tournament wa Senryaku da! is a Sports game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2002.","popularity":1.0,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1041724800000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1041724800000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Jan-05","y":2003,"m":1}]},{"id":49488,"name":"Bakuten Shoot Beyblade 2002: Ikuze!

It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style: ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series. \n \nGameplay \nBefore starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash. \n \nWhen one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will \"attract\" your star towards it. If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad. \n \nWhen not in orbit around a star, you'll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you're going near a large star, then its orbit will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it. \n \nThere are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red. Basically if it's red, you want to stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you're next to an obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you're heading straight towards an obstacle, it's suggested that you get out of its way. Sometimes these hazards will even revolve around stars.","popularity":1.0,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1156636800000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1156636800000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Aug-27","y":2006,"m":8}]},{"id":49514,"name":"Mineko's Night Market","slug":"minekos-night-market","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/minekos-night-market","created_at":1500022481140,"updated_at":1535489970566,"summary":"A whimsical adventure/simulation game where you play as Mineko, a curious girl who has just arrived at her new home on a peculiar Japanese-inspired island overrun by cats.

NTSC-UK gave the game a disappointing 5/10 stating that while it's fun in short bursts, has lovable character animations and is fun to customize your own team, there are limited options, the matches are very slow, and it has a steep learning curve.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1150588800000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1150588800000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Jun-18","y":2006,"m":6}]},{"id":49523,"name":"Boukyaku no Senritsu","slug":"boukyaku-no-senritsu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/boukyaku-no-senritsu","created_at":1500022992654,"updated_at":1500377616766,"summary":"Boukyaku no Senritsu is an Adventure game, developed by Alpha Unit and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2004.","popularity":1.0,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1103932800000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1103932800000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Dec-25","y":2004,"m":12}]},{"id":49524,"name":"Bouken-Ou Beet: Busters Road","slug":"bouken-ou-beet-busters-road","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bouken-ou-beet-busters-road","created_at":1500022995482,"updated_at":1500377617184,"summary":"Bouken-Ou Beet: Busters Road is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2005.","popularity":1.0,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1108857600000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1108857600000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Feb-20","y":2005,"m":2}]},{"id":49525,"name":"Bouken Yuuki Pluster World: Pluston GP","slug":"bouken-yuuki-pluster-world-pluston-gp","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bouken-yuuki-pluster-world-pluston-gp","created_at":1500022999449,"updated_at":1500377617474,"summary":"Bouken Yuuki Pluster World: Pluston GP (Starter Set) is a Racing game, published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 2003.","popularity":1.0,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1053734400000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1053734400000,"region":8,"human":"2003-May-24","y":2003,"m":5}]},{"id":49526,"name":"Bouken Yuuki Pluster World: Densetsu no Pluster Gate EX","slug":"bouken-yuuki-pluster-world-densetsu-no-pluster-gate-ex","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bouken-yuuki-pluster-world-densetsu-no-pluster-gate-ex","created_at":1500023001044,"updated_at":1500377617775,"summary":"Bouken Yuuki Pluster World: Densetsu no Pluster Gate EX is a Role-Playing game, developed by Will and published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 2003.","popularity":1.0,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1073174400000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1073174400000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Jan-04","y":2004,"m":1}]},{"id":49527,"name":"Bouken Yuuki Pluster World: Densetsu no Plust Gate","slug":"bouken-yuuki-pluster-world-densetsu-no-plust-gate","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bouken-yuuki-pluster-world-densetsu-no-plust-gate","created_at":1500023004468,"updated_at":1500377618163,"summary":"Bouken Yuuki Pluster World: Densetsu no Plust Gate is a Role-Playing game, developed by Will and published by Takara, which was released in Japan in 2003.","popularity":1.0,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1053734400000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1053734400000,"region":8,"human":"2003-May-24","y":2003,"m":5}]},{"id":49528,"name":"Bomberman Jetters: Game Collection","slug":"bomberman-jetters-game-collection","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bomberman-jetters-game-collection","created_at":1500023008601,"updated_at":1515770875144,"summary":"A game based on the Bomberman Jetters anime.

New Age Shutsudou is a semi-port/remake of Ganbare Goemon: Shin Sedai Shuumei, containing similar levels and plot to the PlayStation title. New Age Shutsudou was developed and published by Konami Corporation in 2002. The game (as well as Shin Sedai Shuumei) gives the Goemon universe a facelift. It takes place in futuristic Japan, Goemon is skinnier and sports a new hair-do, Ebisumaru is replaced with a shy girl who has a crush on Goemon named Ebisu, and Yae is replaced with Yui, a mermaid-like creature. \n \n The Impact scenes take place inside of a large mech. \nIn terms of gameplay, Goemon: New Age Shutsudou! is a fairly traditional side-scrolling action platformer. The player controls either Goemon or Ebisu, attacking enemies with their respective weapons (which can be leveled up three times in terms of power), and gathering coins. Each level is fairly linear in comparison to earlier Ganbare Goemon titles, and at the end of each level the player is taken to a world map. \n \nSome levels differentiate from this formula. These levels put the player in control of different characters. There are side-scrolling shoot-em-up stages starring characters like Sasuke. The weapon power-up system still works identically here, the gameplay style is just shifted. Additionally, there are stages where the player takes control of Yui, a mermaid-like creature. These stages are underwater. \n \nNew Age Shutsudou marks the return of the first person Impact scenes, which were previously in some of the Super Famicom Goemon games. These scenes put the player in control of a large mech, fighting other robots.

Klonoa Heroes was developed by Namco and published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. Klonoa Heroes is a twist on the traditional Klonoa games, putting Klonoa in a more action role playing game along the lines of Legend of Zelda or Beyond Oasis. The game does have voice acting, as well. Kumiko Watanabe plays Klonoa, Takahiro Sakurai plays Guntz, Shouzou Iizuke plays Pango, and Yutaka Shimaka plays Garlen. \n \nKlonoa Heroes' gameplay is very similar to the gameplay of The Legend of Zelda. Players can control one of three characters (Klonoa, Guntz, and Pango) in a top-down perspective, hitting enemies with various attacks (Klonoa with the Wind Ring seen in the platforming games, albeit with a few differences). Guntz uses a handgun, while Pango throws bombs. In addition, these characters can collect more weapons as the game progresses. Every enemy in the game is given a color (either blue or red), and the player must attack that enemy with the corresponding attack (as each weapon has a blue and red attack). \n \nKlonoa Heroes also has role playing aspects. Experience points are gathered by picking up Dream Shards after defeating enemies (failure to pick them up results in no experience). Enemies also drop coins, which can be spent on items and weapons. These items can be found in chests scattered throughout the levels, as well. Most items can be used to restore health, but there are various other uses (such as stat benefits). Leveling up also allows the player to distribute points in several different areas (traditional role playing game stats, such as attack, defense, and agility). These changes are not permanent, and can be changed at any time (when not in the middle of a level).","popularity":1.0,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1042416000000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1042416000000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Jan-13","y":2003,"m":1}]},{"id":49639,"name":"Goku Mahjong Deluxe: Mirai Senshi 21","slug":"goku-mahjong-deluxe-mirai-senshi-21","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/goku-mahjong-deluxe-mirai-senshi-21","created_at":1500024389090,"updated_at":1500377555836,"summary":"Goku Mahjong Deluxe: Mirai Senshi 21 is a Miscellaneous game, published by Athena, which was released in Japan in 2001.","popularity":1.0,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1000080000000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1000080000000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Sep-10","y":2001,"m":9}]},{"id":49640,"name":"Kiss x Kiss: Seirei Gakuen","slug":"kiss-x-kiss-seirei-gakuen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/kiss-x-kiss-seirei-gakuen","created_at":1500024390315,"updated_at":1500377556101,"summary":"Kiss x Kiss: Seirei Gakuen is a Strategy game, developed by Kamui and published by Bandai, which was released in Japan in 2004.","popularity":1.0,"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":1104624000000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1104624000000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Jan-02","y":2005,"m":1}]},{"id":49641,"name":"Cesti to Meigurumi-tachi no Mahou no Bouken: Kisekko Gurumii","slug":"cesti-to-meigurumi-tachi-no-mahou-no-bouken-kisekko-gurumii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cesti-to-meigurumi-tachi-no-mahou-no-bouken-kisekko-gurumii","created_at":1500024392453,"updated_at":1500377556335,"summary":"Cesti to Meigurumi-tachi no Mahou no Bouken: Kisekko Gurumii is an Adventure game, published by MTO, which was released in Japan in 2003.","popularity":1.0,"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1044057600000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1044057600000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Feb-01","y":2003,"m":2}]},{"id":49642,"name":"Kinniku Banzuke: Kimeru!

from different regions and compete to win the grand prix tournament. You can also create a fighter and select a region and selection of punches and kicks for him. The game represents the fighters as over top cartoony sprites in the same style as puzzle fighter does for street fighter characters. The game plays out in sped up 3 minute rounds and does not represent accurate K-1 fighting as fighters can utilize special moves such as flaming kicks. The game borrows features from other 2D fighters such as street fighter allowing you to do charge attacks, parries, super moves and you win the game by depleting your opponents health bar. The game is a little tongue in cheek, when cro-cop wins a fight he does his winning pose in his famous cop uniform.","collection":4100,"popularity":1.0,"games":[41828,61434,22690,67730,2558,22418,41242,56987,11253,54662],"tags":[268435460,268435470,536870973,536871019,536871213,536872078,536875931,536876266,536876471,536877416,536881482],"category":0,"keywords":[61,107,301,1166,5019,5354,5559,6504,10570],"genres":[4,14],"first_release_date":1041033600000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1041033600000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Dec-28","y":2002,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lewob38ncesgriwoyqk0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lewob38ncesgriwoyqk0","width":514,"height":317}},{"id":49656,"name":"K-1 Pocket Grand Prix","slug":"k-1-pocket-grand-prix","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/k-1-pocket-grand-prix","created_at":1500024586166,"updated_at":1515801250007,"summary":"K-1 Pocket Grand Prix is a kickboxing game, published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 2002. \n \nK-1 Pocket Grand Prix is a fighting game developed by Daft Co. and published by Konami Corporation for Game Boy Advance. \n \nK-1 Pocket Grand Prix is a kickboxing game that uses the K-1 brand and real fighters. \n \nPlayers can choose from one of fourteen different fighters.

It was never released outside of Japan. \n \nShin Bokura no Taiyou: Gyakushuu no Sabata (aka \"Boktai 3\") is the third in a line of action-RPG's conceived by Hideo Kojima, for the GBA. Despite never being released outside of Japan, Boktai 3 has garnered a cult following in English-speaking countries, so much so that a fan-translation was released to the internet. It maintains the tradition of utilizing an in-cart solar sensor in gameplay. \n \nAn undetermined amount of time after the events of Boktai 2, main character Django finds himself sealed in an underground prison by Sabata. Sabata, falling to the Dark Matter that corrupts his body, has once again sided with the Immortals, a vampiric race, and wishes to release the Beast of Destruction, Vanargand, with the intent of becoming the Beast itself. Django recovers and then sets out on a quest to stop Sabata and the Immortals once again, whether that means killing Sabata or not. \n \nBoktai 3, like its two predecessors, is an action-RPG played from an isometric perspective. Players will control Django to traverse an array of different dungeons. Like the first game, Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand, Django will wield the Gun Del Sol (lit: Gun of the Sun) and swords (a feature introduced in Boktai 2 ), in addition to using light stealth elements such as pressing against walls and distracting enemies with noise to sneak by.  \n \nBeing an action-RPG, players can pick up loot, equip various pieces of armor, find weapons, and increase stats. Django has three different stats to upgrade: Vitality (increases Django's Hit Points), Spirit (increases Django's energy capacity when using the Gun Del Sol), and Strength (increases Django's overall attack power with all weapon-types). Armor can be equipped to the head, body, legs, in addition to an accessory. Each piece grants various stat bonuses and/or special effects, while different weapons have different attack powers, special effects, and attack styles.   \n \nUnlike Boktai 2, the Gun Del Sol is, once again, customizable with different lenses (change elemental properties), and different frames (change attack style). However, unlike Boktai 2, spears and hammers are no longer availible as melee weapons; the swords, though, now feature a wide array of effects and attack methods.  \n \nAs in past entries, the Boktai 3 cartridge holds a solar sensor. With it, players can use actual sunlight to affect the game. When Django is outside in the sunlight--or by some source of sunlight while inside--players can refill the Gun Del Sol's energy meter, dry up small water bodies, hasten or slow wind speed, speed up or delay timed hazards, or create \"solar bridges\". How much sunlight is hitting the solar sensor is represented by a 10-segment bar at the bottom of the screen.  \n \nIn dungeons, Django will sneak around, combat enemies, and solve puzzles. Occasionally, the player will find themselves in a \"Trap!\" room or a Mission, where the player will be put against a mini boss(es), or asked to fulfill certain objectives to proceed, respectively. At the end of each dungeon waits a boss, usually one of the Immortals. Django will be put into a life-or-death struggle in entertaining, diverse fights. When the battle is over, the boss is sealed in a coffin, and Django must then drag the coffin back through the dungeon, to the entrance (usually following a second, otherwise inaccessible, route through). Once there, Django will set up the \"Pile Driver\", a device used to destroy the Dark Matter that makes up an Immortal--the only way to actually destroy them--in another fight. Here, is one of the times where sunlight hitting the sensor is mandatory . The boss' life will drain only if sunlight gauge has at least one full segment. \n \nNew to the series, is the complete lack of explorable land outside dungeons. Past games had a full overworld and/or a central hub-town to run around in, and sometimes mini-dungeons other than the main Immortal dungeons. This game does not. The main town is a series of menus and small \"playable\" rooms. In between trips between the town and dungeons, are bike segments, new to the franchise, and unique to this game. Players will ride a bike, completely customizable, in a course-like stretch of land, fighting off enemy bikes and avoiding obstacles.","popularity":1.0,"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1125187200000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1125187200000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Aug-28","y":2005,"m":8}]},{"id":49779,"name":"Shimura

Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":915148800000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":915148800000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Jan-01","y":1999,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kyqwpref8xapbzujpkja.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kyqwpref8xapbzujpkja","width":1530,"height":1370}},{"id":49842,"name":"F1 World Grand Prix II","slug":"f1-world-grand-prix-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/f1-world-grand-prix-ii","created_at":1500030071774,"updated_at":1500377465173,"summary":"F1 World Grand Prix II for Game Boy Color is a Racing game, developed by ITL and published by Video System, which was released in 2000.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":949363200000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":949363200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Feb-01","y":2000,"m":2}]},{"id":49843,"name":"Taxi 3","slug":"taxi-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/taxi-3","created_at":1500030114047,"updated_at":1515757366699,"summary":"Taxi 3 is a Racing game, developed by Visual Impact and published by Ubisoft, which was released in Europe in 2003.","collection":206,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,28154,47823,26196,36868,21063,36846,7606,37137,117],"tags":[268435464,268435466,536871208,536871945,536872961,536875101,536875209,536875396,536876261,536877603,536882447,536884226],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1033,2049,4189,4297,4484,5349,6691,11535,13314],"genres":[8,10],"first_release_date":1045872000000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1045872000000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Feb-22","y":2003,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iwvrefrstz5ckmxwticc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iwvrefrstz5ckmxwticc","width":500,"height":500},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":49844,"name":"Tomato Adventure","slug":"tomato-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tomato-adventure","created_at":1500030116278,"updated_at":1515710194986,"summary":"From AlphaDream and Graphic Research, Tomato Adventure is an RPG released only in Japan. Taking place in a kingdom with tomatoes abound, the gameplay is similar to that of the Mario \u0026 Luigi series. \n \nTomato Adventure, in terms of gameplay mechanics, is the predecessor of the Mario \u0026 Luigi series of games, even having its engine reused in the first installment on the GameBoy Advance. Originally developed for the Game Boy Color, Tomato Adventure transitioned to its successor, the Game Boy Advance, when the latter was released. The main difference between the two versions is believed to lie in the quality of audio and graphics, although little substantial information exists on the Game Boy Color version. \n \nTomato Adventure incorporates a number of RPG standards such as leveling up and travelling to various places to advance the plot. However, the battle system itself is substantially different than most games in the genre, as players have a more active role in how the fights turn out. During the player's turn, they can select a character's attack and then their target. From there, they must perform one of a number of different minigames which determines how successful the attack is. These range from simple button mashers to stopping a meter at a specific point. While attacks can land without reaching the optimal point, their effectiveness tends to be severed in the process. Additionally, each attack has a separate amount of usage points which dictate how many times the player can use that specific attack before needing to revitalize themselves.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76098,36926,25300,12632,36950,51464,36868,27209,26848,55752],"tags":[1,27,268435487,536870990,536871262,536871938,536875074,536877434,536878052,536878078,536881401],"category":0,"keywords":[78,350,1026,4162,6522,7140,7166,10489],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1014595200000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1014595200000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Feb-25","y":2002,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Tomato Adobenchaa","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gefthc1pyaup6if46lp7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gefthc1pyaup6if46lp7","width":583,"height":359}},{"id":49845,"name":"Tokimeki Dream Series 1: Ohanaya-san ni Narou!","slug":"tokimeki-dream-series-1-ohanaya-san-ni-narou","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/tokimeki-dream-series-1-ohanaya-san-ni-narou","created_at":1500030119797,"updated_at":1500377466109,"summary":"Tokimeki Dream Series 1: Ohanaya-san ni Narou!

As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point. \n \nOutside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld.

The action mode in the game is done via four different mini-games which, unlike the adventure mode, use 3rd-person perspective.","collection":4633,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55803,29730,49416,13189,55935,22482,22425,25222,50064,46375],"tags":[268435487,536870990,536871270,536871939,536872225,536873736,536875053,536875054,536875318,536876306,536882449],"category":0,"keywords":[78,358,1027,1313,2824,4141,4142,4406,5394,11537],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":983145600000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":983145600000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Feb-26","y":2001,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o49awwizp37dpgqqwync.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o49awwizp37dpgqqwync","width":400,"height":252}},{"id":50064,"name":"Love Hina Pocket","slug":"love-hina-pocket","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/love-hina-pocket","created_at":1500036201222,"updated_at":1515734948478,"summary":"You are Keitaro Urashima, who has 7 days to do various things in the game, and win the heart of the girl he wants to get.

Но как часто люди смотрят назад, оценивая груз прожитых лет? Иногда судьба заставляет сделать это вне зависимости от наличия у нас желания. Это происходит с главным героем \"The Train\". \nМужчина приходит в себя в тамбуре странного поезда. За окном лишь серые пейзажы размеренно сменяют друг друга. Кто он? Как он здесь оказался? Узнать можно лишь открывая двери. Даже если некоторые из них стоило бы оставить закрытыми на веки вечные. \nПродвигаясь по вагонам мрачного поезда, главный герой встретит необычных пассажиров. Загадочных и неоднозначных. Порой даже пугающих. Найдет множество вещей, которые заставят его заглянуть как в самые темные углы своего прошлого, так и перенестись в самые яркие моменты былого. Понять к чему же привели его поступки и принятые решения. Мы увидим целые картины из жизни. Будь то семейная склока в серой и невзрачной квартире или же прогулка по залитому солнцем пейзажу. \nThe Train предоставит возможность пройти сквозь жизнь главного героя, как сквозь вагоны поезда и в конце концов положить на чаши весов душу. Это будет непростое путешествие. В очередной раз Сергей Носков даст повод любому прикоснувшемуся к его творению задуматься о чем-то своем, с головой окунувшись в атмосферу повествования. Оно ни на секунду не позволит отвлечься от себя. \nThe Train - это ни в коем случае не хоррор и не квест. Задания просты, а «пугающие» моменты не смогу сковать страхом. Жанровые ярлыки в этом случае носят формальный характер. Даже невыразительность геймплея можно при желании простить. Ведь The Train -это всего лишь история. История длиною в жизнь.

The game appeared on Commodore 64, PC, and Sega Genesis, and different versions were published by Electronic Arts, SSI and Stormfront Studios. The artificial intelligence for the computer manager was provided by Tony La Russa, then manager of the Oakland Athletics and later the St. Louis Cardinals. The game was one of the best-selling baseball franchises of the 1990s. \n \nThe game was based on the baseball simulation methods Daglow evolved through the Baseball mainframe computer game (1971) (the first computer baseball game ever written), Intellivision World Series Baseball (1983) and Earl Weaver Baseball (1987). \n \nTLB refined many of the simulation elements of Earl Weaver Baseball, and introduced a few \"firsts\" of its own: \n \nUser Interface and the Fly Ball Cursor -- Prior to Intellivision World Series Baseball in 1983 all hits in baseball games were grounders, since there was no way to display the ball in flight in 3D. After World Series Baseball, from 1983-1990 games had fly balls but used a ball-shaped shadow to trace the ball's path on the ground. This made catching fly balls difficult, since users couldn't tell how high the ball was if it was off the screen. In La Russa Daglow designed a circular Fly Ball Cursor that appeared where the ball was going to land, and grew or diminished in size based on the height of the ball. If the wind was blowing the cursor would move its location to reflect the changing course of the ball. The Fly Ball Cursor introduced real fly balls and pop-ups to computer baseball games, eliminating the last segment of the sport that had never been simulated accurately. Every graphic baseball game published since 1991 has used some variation on Daglow's Fly Ball Cursor for outfield play. \nFantasy Draft -- La Russa was the first computer baseball game to allow users to conduct drafts and set up their own leagues, all with access to the game's comprehensive player statistics. Tony La Russa would draft on behalf of all non-human users in a league, and users could tune the AI draft strategy uniquely for each team. The draft features were enhanced in later versions. \nHead-to-Head Stats and Simulation Accuracy -- La Russa was the first baseball game to offer accurate stats for each individual pitcher against each individual hitter, data that actual managers use extensively in the dugout. Player stats and ratings were supplied by baseball sabermetrics pioneers John Thorn and Pete Palmer. \nBaseball stadiums -- Ballparks in the game were larger and more richly detailed than any prior game. Add-on disks allowed users to play in real Major League ballparks. \nAI -- In contrast to many sports celebrities who merely lent their names to games, Tony La Russa spent extensive sessions over a period of years working to make the game's artificial intelligence as accurate as possible. The team leveraged the lessons learned working with Earl Weaver to make the \"baseball manager as game designer\" feedback loop even more efficient. \nThe first version of La Russa, Tony La Russa's Ultimate Baseball, was released almost exactly twenty years after the first playable version of Baseball went live at Pomona College in 1971.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"keywords":[20,1166,4658],"genres":[14]},{"id":50102,"name":"V for Victory: D-Day Utah Beach","slug":"v-for-victory-d-day-utah-beach","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/v-for-victory-d-day-utah-beach","created_at":1500036653989,"updated_at":1516164660091,"summary":"V for Victory: D-Day Utah Beach is a turn-based strategy wargame for the Macintosh and MS-DOS developed by Atomic Games in 1991 and distributed by Three-Sixty Pacific.

It was released in Europe on 8 August 2004 and later in North America on 8 March 2005. The game is a spin on American football, the violence of the Medieval football with no rules and rugby-style of sports yet set in a fantasy world with teams being made up of fantasy races such as dwarves, elves, orcs and undead, along with the use of magic and other fictional elements during a \"match\". The tone of the game is satirical with comedic color commentary and adverts for fictional in-game universe products. An official expansion was later released in 2005 bundled with the original, titled Chaos League: Sudden Death that added new features and gameplay tweaks. \n \nWhile not a direct video game adaption, Chaos League bears resemblance to Games Workshop's Blood Bowl tabletop board game, which is also about fantasy sports. Cyanide Studios would later develop the video game version of Blood Bowl in 2009, which itself utilizes certain features from Chaos League.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[23345,26769,65832,18623,4843,36926,7329,26841,19407,19083],"tags":[1,22,27,268435470,268435471,536870938,536870939,536871008,536871063,536871208,536871262,536871938,536872078,536872232,536872978,536874694,536875074,536875265,536875316,536876235,536877040,536877686,536878073,536878352,536880933,536884022],"category":0,"keywords":[26,27,96,151,296,350,1026,1166,1320,2066,3782,4162,4353,4404,5323,6128,6774,7161,7440,10021,13110],"themes":[1,22,27],"genres":[14,15]},{"id":50121,"name":"Bridge Builder","slug":"bridge-builder","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bridge-builder","created_at":1500036753239,"updated_at":1513068199256,"summary":"Bridge Builder is a puzzle video game series, created by US-based indie developer Alex Austin.

Fans of the original game will notice new features and gameplay improvements, including new melee animations, the ability to check your watch and ammo supplies on the fly, and new full-body player animations. \n \nAnd those who favoured the more survival-horror oriented gameplay of the cult prequel ‘Metro 2033’ will find a new way to experience the campaign thanks to the introduction of two unique Play Styles – Survival and Spartan. The former transforms Last light from a more action-oriented stealth combat experience to a fraught, slow burn fight for survival. With the legendary Ranger Mode included to offer an extra layer of challenge and immersion, Metro: Last Light Redux offers hours of AAA gameplay for an incredible price. \n \nGame Features \n \nImmerse yourself in the Moscow Metro - witness one of the most atmospheric worlds in gaming brought to life with stunning next-gen visuals at 60FPS Brave the horrors of the Russian apocalypse - equip your gasmask and an arsenal of hand-made weaponry as you face the threat of deadly mutants, human foes, and the terrifying environment itself \n   \nRebuilt and Remastered for next-gen - with all previous DLC content included, new modes and features, and many gameplay improvement, this is the definitive version of the critically acclaimed classic that fans and newcomers alike will enjoy \n   \nTwo unique Play Styles : \"Spartan\" and \"Survival\" - approach the game as a slow burn Survival Horror, or tackle it with the combat skills of a Spartan Ranger in these two unique modes \n   \nThe legendary Ranger Mode returns - dare you play the fearsome Ranger Mode?

The mutants still roam the desolate remains of Moscow above and the dark abandoned tunnels around. The resources are even scarcer, but there is still hope – the huge D6 bunker you, Artyom, and your comrades discovered while on your quest to rid the Metro of mortal danger. In its vast expanse it might contain the key to survival; it might hold incredible stores of supplies which the survivors are running out of. \n \nIt might be the salvation – but it could also bring about the complete ruin of humanity, for the factions within Metro are gearing up for an all-out war for whatever it might contain. This one could well become the War to End All Wars, since after it ends there will probably be no one to wage war anymore. It truly is the dusk of humanity – and dusk leads to the nigh. Night, which is going to last forever this time. \n \nWill you be able to avert the impending doom? Will you find courage and understanding to right the wrongs that you did and save humanity from itself? Will you even survive?","collection":82,"rating":85.8881406952972,"popularity":6.333333333333333,"total_rating":85.8881406952972,"total_rating_count":13,"rating_count":13,"version_parent":539,"version_title":"Redux","games":[103020,103298,68287,90099,31712,103282,59516,36608,55038,103281],"tags":[1,21,23,268435461,268435468,1073741825],"developers":[314],"publishers":[423],"game_engines":[18],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,21,23],"genres":[5,12],"first_release_date":1409011200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,92,14,48,49,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1409270400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Aug-29","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1409270400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Aug-29","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1409270400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Aug-29","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1409270400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Aug-29","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1409270400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Aug-29","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1409270400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Aug-29","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1409011200000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Aug-26","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1409011200000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Aug-26","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1409011200000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Aug-26","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1409011200000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Aug-26","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1409011200000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Aug-26","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1409011200000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Aug-26","y":2014,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rsufnxkpr1nwjocbk9il.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rsufnxkpr1nwjocbk9il","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jpavjxsaugefp3sb8fdb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jpavjxsaugefp3sb8fdb","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kryz3jzufpuvfbnbtlje.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kryz3jzufpuvfbnbtlje","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qeapdgwuwub3l8izzgsb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qeapdgwuwub3l8izzgsb","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fpetgb32llqjauhrykcx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fpetgb32llqjauhrykcx","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ziDwiguySWo"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uvjzfazmcfrfx0llgodt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uvjzfazmcfrfx0llgodt","width":756,"height":1080},"esrb":{"synopsis":"Platform: PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/287390"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/metrovideogame"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/metrovideogame"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/metrovideogame"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/MetroVideoGame"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro:_Last_Light#Redux_version"},{"category":2,"url":"http://metrovideogame.wikia.com"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.4a-games.com/metro-last-light.html"}]},{"id":50200,"name":"Flickers","slug":"flickers","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/flickers","created_at":1500037886960,"updated_at":1516694367779,"summary":"Flickers is an abstract, atmospheric, timing-based 2D platformer following the journey of the player from the heart of a dying flower through a world blanketed in perpetual twilight.

It is based on Doom3D, though rewritten for OpenGL rather than DirectX, and including some bug fixes from Boom and MBF. It aims to recreate the look and feel of Doom 64 as closely as possible, based on specifications obtained through reverse engineering, similarly to how Kaiser also created SvStrife. \n \nThe first public version of Doom64 EX was released on July 10, 2008. \n \nCompared to the Doom 64: Absolution TC, the principal difference is that Doom64 EX uses the original data. A tool provided with the port can create a DOOM64.WAD IWAD from the ROM. \n \nDoom 64 plays almost identically to earlier games in the Doom series; the player must advance through numerous levels fighting demons, collecting weapons and keys and hitting switches in order to reach the level's exit while surviving deadly traps and ambushes. Changes were made to the Doom engine for use in Doom 64, and gameplay elements were altered. \n \nWeapons \nAll the weapons from the original game are present, but redrawn with new sprites. The chainsaw was given two blades instead of one, the fists have bloodstained gloves on instead of brass knuckles, the plasma rifle has an electric core that emits a sparking sound when equipped, the rocket launcher has a small kick when fired, pushing the player back a bit, the shotgun's reloading cock is at the handle instead of under the barrel and the Super Shotgun reloads faster and causes recoil. \n \nA new weapon known as the Laser, or \"Unmaker\", was added, using the same cell ammunition as the plasma rifle and BFG. It was first mentioned in the Doom Bible and was planned to be featured in the PC Doom games but never appeared. Its appearance in Doom 64 is its only official appearance. With the power of three ancient artifacts found in the game, it becomes more powerful by shooting three laser beams (at a quicker rate than default) instead of one. The first artifact increases the laser speed, the second artifact adds a second laser and the third artifact allows the weapon to fire three simultaneous lasers which can automatically aim separately from one another, allowing the weapon to attack three different enemies at once. \n \nPlot \nFollowing the conclusion of the original Doom series, the sole Marine who survived the horrors of hell had returned to Earth, reclaiming it from the invasion that almost eradicated the human race. Demons still lingered within the abandoned halls and complexes of Phobos and Deimos. As a last-ditch effort, the military decided to bombard the moons with extreme radiation in hopes of killing off any remaining demons. Initially it was successful, however something survived the exposure. The radiation blocked the military's sensors and allowed something to slip past them undetected. This mysterious entity, possessing the ability to resurrect any demon it came across, recreated the entire demonic horde and made it stronger than ever before. A Marine strike force was ordered to contain the advancing armies of hell but was mercilessly slaughtered within moments. The player's character is the sole survivor of this group.","popularity":1.0,"category":0,"themes":[1,19],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1218326400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1218326400000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Aug-10","y":2008,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hswts2jgmcymd6nsoymp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hswts2jgmcymd6nsoymp","width":1711,"height":1541}},{"id":50251,"name":"Archage","slug":"archage","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/archage","created_at":1500039563191,"updated_at":1517347556517,"summary":"ArcheAge is a MMORPG based on Eastern and Western fantasy world view.","popularity":2.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1413417600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1413417600000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Oct-16","y":2014,"m":10}]},{"id":50252,"name":"Get Lost!","slug":"get-lost","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/get-lost","created_at":1500039565391,"updated_at":1515582950922,"summary":"Attempt to find exits in mazes in this first person 3d maze game from Tom Bombadil's Software Emporium \u0026 House of Curiosities.

The levels are procedurally generated, allowing for a unique game in every play.","popularity":1.0,"games":[82857,70707,69505,82761,82842,82750,82687,57296,82941,82917],"tags":[536871938,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[72,416,578,603,604,720,1026,1318],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[14,13,16,3],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":3,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nh79pvp7wpysgetuisl6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nh79pvp7wpysgetuisl6","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kuxy1hu01dd30t6ustfs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kuxy1hu01dd30t6ustfs","width":640,"height":400},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o8tuhk3dlenssa6gzhe8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o8tuhk3dlenssa6gzhe8","width":1281,"height":604}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dtm7xd4sghvlgsn8um1u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dtm7xd4sghvlgsn8um1u","width":1038,"height":576},"websites":[{"category":14,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/angband"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_(video_game)"},{"category":1,"url":"http://rephial.org/"}]},{"id":50262,"name":"X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants","slug":"x-men-ii-the-fall-of-the-mutants","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/x-men-ii-the-fall-of-the-mutants","created_at":1500039625778,"updated_at":1513086822400,"summary":"In X-Men 2: The Fall of the Mutants the player must assemble a team of five X-Men from a selection of fifteen, and eliminate the evil mutants while playing in a top-down RPG-style environment.

But one day, their land was attacked, and the talisman stolen. A brave warrior went out to investigate the talisman's disappearance, but returned mortally wounded. Before he died, he told his three sons that the talisman was stolen by the evil Necromancer, and must be retrieved at all costs... \n \nThe Faery Tale Adventure is a role-playing game in which the player can assume control of any of the three brothers - Julian, Philip, or Kevin. Each of the three has his own strengths: Julian is the archetypal melee fighter, Philip has high luck and intelligence, while Kevin is known for his kindness. Should the player fail while controlling one of the brothers, the next one will replace him. Each brother will be revived a few times when vanquished by an enemy, until his luck runs out, at which point he will die permanently. \n \nMuch of the gameplay is dedicated to exploring the large world, interacting with non-playable characters and building up the brothers' combat abilities by participating in battles. The fastest-growing parameter is bravery, which is comparable to experience points and strength combined. Each defeated enemy yields bravery points; as it grows, so does the hero's vitality (maximum hit points), albeit at a slower rate. Combat system is rather simple and is done in action style, with the player pressing a key or a mouse button while navigating the protagonist towards or away from the enemy. Predating Ultima V, the game has a day and night cycle, and the main character has to eat and rest. \n \nThe Faery Tale Adventure is notable for having a very vast world, usually considered the largest ever created for a video game at the time of its release.

Neverwinter Nights 2 is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him.

Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast. Then, yet another adventure: in an ancient and forgotten tomb you found an unusual mask. It made you quite powerful but changed your life into a living nightmare. Strange, terrifying visions torment your psyche. Every time you try to get rid of the accursed mask, it secretly makes its way back to you.

The game is sure to draw in players interested in resource management and creating things. It takes concepts from successful crafting games from as far back at Exodus Ultima IV and as recent as Star Wars Galaxies. What it does not do is create repetitive and mostly boring craft/grind style gameplay and instead focuses on mining, building, experimentation and delivery of goods to market. \n \nThe most interesting part of the game, at least to me, is the graphics style being based off of terminal and mainframe computers from the 1970's.

Game play can be either open ended or set to a specified number turns. There is no set objective to gameplay (except for your 4X's) and the story line is almost non-existant: It is the year 2525 and as your race begins its first step in extra-planetary colonization, you discover that you are not alone in the galaxy. You must compete with up to 5 other races in colonizing planets, and the near lack of diplomatic interaction in the game pretty much insures that you will need to build defenses early on. Unlike Master of Orion, diplomacy only occurs when an opponent requests peace, but you cannot make such requests yourself. \n \nArmada 2525 offers a fair assortment of ships (approx. 20) and buildings (approx. 15), which can only be built after the appropriate technological advance. One can build research labs which are dedicated to one of eight available scientific fields: weapons, construction, hyperspace, force fields, biotech, planetology, info science, and psycho science. Combat can be controlled to an extent - though you cannot affect the individual actions of ships, you can issue general orders and arrange them into formations. \n \nYour race will start at a predetermined homeworld from which it will expand to colonize new solar systems in the usual 4X quest of exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating of your opponents.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}]},{"id":50402,"name":"Christmas Mission","slug":"christmas-mission","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/christmas-mission","created_at":1500040993030,"updated_at":1522159374462,"summary":"Christmas Mission is a new android game. \nSanta needs your help to deliver all the presents ! \nCome and try this game ! \nJust tap to make a gift fall to the marked zone.","storyline":"Santa needs your help to deliver all the gifts ! \nJust tap and make the gifts rain !","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[28277,24048,25311,26145,26163,41895,28465,47823,34919,54999],"tags":[17,268435469,268435487,268435488,268435489,536871500,536871744,536871793,536873631,1073741828],"developers":[13129],"publishers":[13129],"game_engines":[410],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[588,832,881,2719],"themes":[17],"genres":[13,31,32,33],"first_release_date":1499990400000,"status":2,"platforms":[34],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1499990400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jul-14","y":2017,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mvgvg8ajkgtryckzq4eq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mvgvg8ajkgtryckzq4eq","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wdh4vp6lxb2cfyiii81q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdh4vp6lxb2cfyiii81q","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qdapukafdylvmowxujln.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qdapukafdylvmowxujln","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uwupjh1mnwfdplhwri5l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uwupjh1mnwfdplhwri5l","width":1080,"height":1920},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kntsyc1txyeu0aponv5g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kntsyc1txyeu0aponv5g","width":1080,"height":1920}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wyqxbfntxdfzt0cnm6hm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wyqxbfntxdfzt0cnm6hm","width":1080,"height":1920},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/778450"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/arx_enterprises"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/Christmas-Mission-838557702971758"}],"external":{"steam":"778450"}},{"id":50403,"name":"Elona - Eternal League of Nefia","slug":"elona-eternal-league-of-nefia","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/elona-eternal-league-of-nefia","created_at":1500041358504,"updated_at":1530780359613,"summary":"Elona is a roguelike game created by Japanese developer Noa.

Players not only control the combat units (ranging from infantry and tanks to helicopters, fighters and bombers, armored trains, surface warships and submarines, stationary gun turrets), but (especially in the later games) also many support logistics units (ammo and fuel transports, scout and radar units, road and construction vehicles, and others). Units have various weapons and can gain experience (which in later games can be transferred over in a campaign). Fuel and ammo is limited, and logistics require careful attention. Players also control buildings, where units can be repaired, and sometimes, produced. Weather conditions change, affecting unit movements (for example, a sea or river can freeze, immobilizing ships but allowing light units to move through it). Fog of war is prevalent and players have to use scouting units to gain information about the battlefield. Some of those options were added in expansions or sequels. \n \nPlayers have various tasks, ranging from eliminating all opponent forces to capturing specific buildings or protecting certain units or places. In some missions events from outside the battlefield can suddenly change the situation, giving players new objectives, reinforcements, allies or enemies. In some battles there are more than two sides, each with their own objectives, not all of them directly involved in hostilities - some of them can be even allied. At the same time, those allegiances can change because of some events or actions. \n \nBattle Isle one had the screen divided into two parts, one for each player. The turns were also divided into move and attack phases. While one player moved his units, the other commanded his own troops to carry out his actions. Battle Isle 2 gave the player the entire screen, and merged move and attack phases, and introduced the 3-D display of combat. Battle Isle 3 was very similar to Battle Isle 2, with improved graphics, more units and a new storyline. Battle Isle: The Andosian War was entirely set in the 3-D environment and combined elements of real-time and turn-based strategies. \n \nThe AI is relatively weak, relying on mass frontal assaults. After a player survives the first few turns and the AI's overwhelming numbers using protected artillery and terrain advantage, the computer is usually unable to mount a proper defense.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":975628800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":975628800000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Dec-01","y":2000,"m":12}]},{"id":50410,"name":"London Underground Simulator - World of Subways Vol.3","slug":"london-underground-simulator-world-of-subways-vol-dot-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/london-underground-simulator-world-of-subways-vol-dot-3","created_at":1500041378121,"updated_at":1500462469030,"summary":"World of Subways\" is our series of the most interesting Subway and Underground routes of the world for the PC.

In Gosling it seemed the sun always shined, your neighbors smiled, and the harvests were bountiful. Yes, life in the valley was good. Factor in the mushrooms, and well, life wasn't just good, it was great! \n \nAh yes, the mushrooms. The valley was full of them, and each one was special. There were enormous mushrooms that were used as homes, and small ones that could be brewed into liquor (including everyone's tavern favorite, ShroOOom! ale). Some mushrooms were best buttered and fried, while other mushrooms were typically dried and smoked. There were mushrooms that healed the sick, and even some that could make magic! \n \nThen the troubles began. Bizarre creatures prowled the valley, the wildlife fled, and once full larders laid bare. The citizens of Gosling smiled at each other no more, instead spending their days hiding in terror. Worse, with the blight upon the land the mushrooms that once provided so much now provided so little. Even the casks of ShroOOom! ale were almost dry! \n \nBig Will, an old farmer, sought out the source of the evil. Nestled high in the hills, he found the source: a dank and dark cave that oozed evil, a terrible open sore in the land that spewed forth nightmares. Big Will did not go in, though. He'd let someone else have all the glory. Someone, such as YOU! \n \nYou are Rapius, mighty farm laborer. The blood of the Gods do not flow in your veins. You were not prophesized about a thousand years prior by three blind crones. Yet it is you, Rapius, that will seek out and destroy the source of evil. \n \nRapius, grab your lantern and make haste! For the good of the people, the lands, and the mushrooms - especially the mushrooms! Have you seen what they're charging for a pint of ShroOOm! ale lately? Go forth, descend into the earth! Leave a tramp and come back a scallywag! All of Gosling awaits your triumph - your triumph in the lair of the Medusa! \n \nScallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa is a single-player, action orientated dungeonbash of unlimited potential. Taking the role of Rapius players fight their way through eighty levels of randomly generated dungeon exploration, braving dozens of unique subterranean dangers in a quest to cleanse the ultimate evil within the catacombs. \n \nDown in the dark players will gain gear, craft items, learn magic, eat 'shrooms, turn to stone, become invisible, get drunk, be hungover, learn to fly, speed up, muscle up, regenerate, smoke fungus, get diseased, get lost, get found, and more! Careful use of Rapius' lantern will allow players to strike from afar, or for tough encounters, sneak by silently in the dark. \n \nScallywag: In the Lair of the Medusa also comes complete with RAGe, the Random Adventure Game engine. Craft whole new adventures for Rapius, or even make entirely new games!

The player can win by controlling the enemy capitals (Highlord capital is Neraka and the Whitestone capitals are the four Knight countries (Solanthus, Caergoth, Gunthar, and Northern Ergoth) plus the Clerist Tower near Palanthus. If neither side can capture the enemy capitals by the end of the game (which is Mar/Apr 354), the side with more points (calculated from the size of their forces) wins. Each game year has 5 turns.","popularity":1.0,"games":[55036,29173,55590,23345,19376,9760,33603,36962,76731,55888],"tags":[268435471,536874694,536878358],"category":0,"keywords":[3782,7446],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Advanced Dungeons \u0026 Dragons: War of the Lance","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c5ebwbjcndr79evxabjq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c5ebwbjcndr79evxabjq","width":300,"height":460}},{"id":50495,"name":"Where in America's Past Is Carmen Sandiego?","slug":"where-in-americas-past-is-carmen-sandiego","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/where-in-americas-past-is-carmen-sandiego","created_at":1500042373425,"updated_at":1513072911477,"summary":"This game is widely considered the most informational game of the entire series.

Balance of Power dealt with politics in the cold war, its successor Balance of the Planet simulates nothing less than Earth's ecosystem. Although Maxis' Sim Earth is often credited as the first \"ecosim\", the title rightfully belongs to Crawford's game. Both games are equally interesting nevertheless, as they use two vastly different approaches to an enormously complex subject. \n \nSim Earth tries to simulate the natural processes, i.e. continental drift, weather, global temperature etc. as accurately as possible, and calculates the global impact from this basic conditions. Balance of the Planet breaks down the ecological system into 150 single factors, connected in a cause-and-effect network. Rather than experiencing the ecosystem as a whole, you discover a string of subjects that influence each other. For example, when dealing with global warming, you'd be referred to carbon dioxides and methane (the causes) and rising sea level (the result). By following and understanding the links, you may thus find out in which way beef production influences inundation. There is, however, no accurate simulation of a global ecology, rather than a sophisticated schematic of factors and problems. \n \nContrary to Sim Earth, you do not change the mechanisms of nature themselves. Instead, you're to try to influence society by funding and granting subsidies. If you raise the tax on coal considerably, coal burning and thus carbon dioxide output will be discouraged, but the strain on other forms of energy will increase. You'd be best advised to subsidise renewable energies -- which leaves less money for other pressing problems. Your job is to balance the ecology with the age-old system of reward and punishment. This has to be done in only nine turns; you are awarded or subtracted points, depending on your success. \n \nBalance of the Planet is highly customisable. You may not only load \"biased\" games, in which you play with a certain prejudice (e.g. pro-nuclear), but also change all the formulas used for calculations to your liking.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44242,24491,28465,75579,75275,34919,75102,33603,36962,55888],"tags":[268435469],"category":0,"keywords":[534,1148,8915],"themes":[34],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dohm1fn19b9al8kdu5ba.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dohm1fn19b9al8kdu5ba","width":420,"height":502}},{"id":50500,"name":"Adventures of Maddog Williams In The Dungeons of Duridian","slug":"adventures-of-maddog-williams-in-the-dungeons-of-duridian","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/adventures-of-maddog-williams-in-the-dungeons-of-duridian","created_at":1500042384714,"updated_at":1500468829416,"summary":"The player takes the role of Maddog Williams who wants to rescue the beautiful Princess Leoria and free her father King Thaylor.

The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game's 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O'Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game's release. \n \nThe management side of O'Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team. \n \nAs with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player's selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country's football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Denílson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning. \n \nThe club's board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team. \n \nSimilarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to \"do training\", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,54662,55689,55590,44242,40470,18623,11679,9199,22470],"tags":[268435469,268435470,536871906,536872060,536872078,536875090,536875433,536875562],"category":0,"keywords":[994,1148,1166,4178,4521,4650],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":971568000000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":971568000000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Oct-15","y":2000,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p26lapqrmna33r2qkz5p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p26lapqrmna33r2qkz5p","width":494,"height":500}},{"id":50551,"name":"Robot Ponkottsu Star Version","slug":"robot-ponkottsu-star-version","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/robot-ponkottsu-star-version","created_at":1500049503055,"updated_at":1500383855497,"summary":"Within Robopon Sun, Star, and Moon versions, the player assumes the role of a child named Cody, whose grandpa is retiring and gives him the family business, a Robopon Dispatching Company.

They lost their parents at an early age, never knowing what actually happened to them. One day, a letter came from a wealthy person living on an island somewhere in the western Japan Sea. Upon receiving this letter, they realized the golden statue belongs to the place from which the letter was sent. If this is a family heirloom, could the person who sent the letter be someone related to them? Can they know what happened to Satomi and Miki's parents? As Conan and the others opened the Togawa sisters' request, they decided to help uncover the mystery behind their lineage and golden statue and set off on a trip to the solitary island in question where ships travel to only twice a week. As they arrive on the island of strange shape, the notice the residents of an island village appear a bit weird, and there seem to be history behind the wealthy island family. And to top it all, the murder in front of the wealthy looking western-style estate occurred just in front on them and the murderer ran away from the scene of the crime. It's Conan's task to solve all the mysteries and catch the killer, for by his own words, the truth is always only one.","collection":3038,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[72412,59516,55289,13189,36792,25222,36044,55803,41895,25311],"tags":[268435468,268435487,536871939,536872581],"category":0,"keywords":[1027,1669],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":957139200000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":957139200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-May-01","y":2000,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hqxibapmqjrlfymy6iuc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hqxibapmqjrlfymy6iuc","width":255,"height":320}},{"id":50562,"name":"Hello Kitty no Magical Museum","slug":"hello-kitty-no-magical-museum","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hello-kitty-no-magical-museum","created_at":1500049593618,"updated_at":1500383858988,"summary":"Hello Kitty no Magical Museum is a Puzzle game, developed by Atelier Double and published by Imagineer, which was released in Japan in 1999.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":927849600000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":927849600000,"region":8,"human":"1999-May-28","y":1999,"m":5}]},{"id":50563,"name":"Daiku no Gen-san: Kachikachi no Tonkachi ga Kachi","slug":"daiku-no-gen-san-kachikachi-no-tonkachi-ga-kachi","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/daiku-no-gen-san-kachikachi-no-tonkachi-ga-kachi","created_at":1500049601094,"updated_at":1515855791187,"summary":"Daiku no Gen-san: Kachikachi no Tonkachi ga Kachi is an action/platforming game developed by Biox and published by Gaps for the Game Boy Color platform.

While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel. \n \nThe Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Durán, Alexis Argüello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's \"slugfest\" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics. \n \nIn Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines. \n \nIn Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar. \n \nKnockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either \"boxer\" or \"slugger\" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either \"boxer\", \"slugger\", \"freestyle\", or \"crab\", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times.

At this time, the game already was completely finished. \n \nIn Bound High!, Chalvo, the bouncing robot, travels through space In full 3d-D motion in pursuit of alien invaders that threaten the peaceful inhabitants of Earth. Angling from above, players control rolled up Chalvo, who must destroy all enemies on the playfield by landing on them and throwing them down from the playfield. Falling off the playfield himself, Chalvo will loose a life. \nThe playfield is in space, or high above the earth, and is made of many little squares, which are composed differently from level to level, once big plain areas, once many small, scattered blocks. Bouncing over the platforms can be quite incalculable and dangerous, while some are solid, other ones vanish after one hit or reveal puzzles, items or other objects and besides a lot of different enemies, Chalvo also has to carefully avoid winds, the deep crevices, sharp spikes and highly charged electric \"shockers\" that cause his demise. Adding to the difficulty is the rebound angle when you hit a moving enemy - you don't necessarily bounce straight up in the air. \nSometimes blocks lead to an \"Another Stage\", some kind of mirrored parallel universe with inverted colors and without the dangerous winds.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,36608,19222,34919,41348,40524,2969,23175,10225,16468],"tags":[1,268435465],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":843696000000,"platforms":[87],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":87,"date":843696000000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Sep-26","y":1996,"m":9}]},{"id":50597,"name":"Virtual Fishing","slug":"virtual-fishing","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/virtual-fishing","created_at":1500050360247,"updated_at":1518019206393,"summary":"Virtual Fishing is a Sports game, developed by Locomotive Corporation and published by Pack-In-Video, which was released in Japan in 1995.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49979,49650,47336,5121,44944,38167,37773,25203,68943,67697],"tags":[268435470,536871421,536872928,536875232,536875233,536875753],"publishers":[1766],"category":0,"keywords":[509,2016,4320,4321,4841],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":815616000000,"platforms":[87],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":87,"date":815616000000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Nov-06","y":1995,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/daxci37ayeb0srx4tckf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"daxci37ayeb0srx4tckf","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ugy9xm9wt2xjeewdlenx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ugy9xm9wt2xjeewdlenx","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dxeoojrjcnf3hfseoaoy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dxeoojrjcnf3hfseoaoy","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhvapp1oh84zybquxdxc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fhvapp1oh84zybquxdxc","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/stzmldxnv1nj4dwqxm5m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"stzmldxnv1nj4dwqxm5m","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jfpdwubxaz3lwfyr7jh7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jfpdwubxaz3lwfyr7jh7","width":384,"height":224}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/woj7ijwj8iwwcgb8gj5d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"woj7ijwj8iwwcgb8gj5d","width":319,"height":315}},{"id":50598,"name":"The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Limited Edition","slug":"the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-limited-edition--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-limited-edition--1","created_at":1500050363881,"updated_at":1532641162807,"summary":"Forget everything you know about The Legend of Zelda games.

Electronic Arts told MTV Asia that \"EA Screen will provide visitors a chance to interact with EA's game producers hailing from the studios, and unveil the hugely anticipated SPORE Creature Creator demo version to gamers for the first time in Asia.\"[2] Electronic Arts VP Mark Buechner stated on the Spore Facebook page that the editor would be released in June or July 2008, saying, \"We are looking at releasing it two to three months before the launch of the full game.\"[3] \n \nThe SimCity Box artwork showed a blurb stating that the creature editor would be included with it.[4] IGN revealed that the Spore Creature Creator utility will be available in two different versions on June 18, 2008.[5] There was a paid version (for $9.95) and a free demo that was downloadable from Spore.com and included for free, bundled with The SimCity Box. The free version of the editor only contained 25% of the available creature parts that were found within the full version. In Australia, on August 30, 2008, three state newspapers owned by News Limited offered the full version either free or for $2.[6] \n \nThe utility includes a test environment for players to see their creatures go through animations and allowed the player to import other user-created creatures through the Sporepedia at Spore.com. The utility included screen capture and video tools as well,[5] including YouTube functionality.[7] The editor also gave the user the ability to create animated avatars,[8] and output in RSS and embeddable HTML code to facilitate easy incorporation into such sites as MySpace and Facebook.[9] The software is automatically superseded by Spore when it is installed, since the Creature editor is already present on the game. \n \nShortly after its introduction, the Creature Creator was used to create creatures with oversized genitalia, either stand-alone or engaged in coitus (a phenomenon quickly dubbed \"sporn\").[10] EA responded with e-mails sent to those who made pornographic machinima from its demo, and has flagged certain on-line accounts for \"TOS violations\".[11] Furthermore, YouTube has pulled several such videos for violations of its own TOS.[12] \n \nBy June 24, 2008, users had already uploaded over one million creatures to the site.[13] During Electronic Arts' E3 2008 presentation on July 14, 2008, Wright humorously noted that fans had done God's work at 38% efficiency by creating the same number of currently known species on Earth, 1,589,000, in about 18 days, compared to God's 6 days.[14] When Spore debuted on September 1, 2008, over 3 million creatures had been added to the Sporepedia via the Spore Creature Creator. \n \nWhen installing Spore, Spore Creature Creator must be uninstalled.","collection":352,"popularity":1.0,"games":[22425,44242,18623,22470,29173,26145,55590,55689,22406,23867],"tags":[268435469,536872060,536872611,536872810,536875271,536875432,536875735,536876581,536877755,536878467,536879774,536880294,536883035,536883988,536884507],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,1699,1898,4359,4520,4823,5669,6843,7555,8862,9382,12123,13076,13595],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":1216339200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1216339200000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Jul-18","y":2008,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vo2tafh1vlgpczhlrhc2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vo2tafh1vlgpczhlrhc2","width":640,"height":830}},{"id":50795,"name":"Face Off!","slug":"face-off--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/face-off--1","created_at":1500054271163,"updated_at":1515664822127,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[22690,15851,36608,34919,55715,14713,80292,78813,78041,78015],"tags":[1,268435470,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[1166],"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":602294400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":602294400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Feb-01","y":1989,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ysxzzep07cauvfwk7org.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ysxzzep07cauvfwk7org","width":320,"height":200}},{"id":50796,"name":"Constantine The Video Game","slug":"constantine-the-video-game","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/constantine-the-video-game","created_at":1500054273119,"updated_at":1500467718297,"summary":"John Constantine is the name of the main character in the Hellblazer comic by Vertigo DC.

New game features include a ranked difficulty for the computer opponent, denoted by a star gauge in the Duel menu, which ranks from 1 star to 9. As you win duels, the difficulty increases, and the opponent swaps his Deck for a more potent one every time this happens. Later difficulty levels (8-9) allow the opponent to use different Decks in that same level. Losing consecutive duels results in decreased difficulty for the first time in Power of Chaos games. Other options include allowing the opponent to use cards from the previous two games, increasing the difficulty. Also, the option to make many Limited cards Forbidden is given, making the game more balanced. One other new addition to the game is that when you win cards that you already have, you may have a choice of getting different cards, or keep the ones you've earned. This can only be done when every card you win in a match or one card in a single duel is a common card, not new.

This game is not based on the movie Starship Troopers. Both, the game and the movie, are based upon the novel by Robert A. Heinlein. \n \nThis is one of the few strategy games where you cannot build a base and recruit units. Instead you lead up to three squads into combat. Each squad contains a leader, five soldiers and one specialist (medic, engineer, PSI for detecting hidden bugs, MIST-Trooper as a sniper). During a mission there is no reinforcement and you are outnumbered by the bugs. The enemy units are not very intelligent, but they use their own special abilities like splitting acid and are very powerful. There is a wide range of enemies, from simple close-range fighters to suicide units, artillery bugs and even human soldiers. The mission objectives are also different. From simple hunting missions up to escorts or the capturing of bugs. \n \nThe game also have a RPG part. Surviving soldiers gain experience points for each killed bug / destroyed bug holes. By and by the soldiers increase their states and acquire higher ranks. Better battle suits (armor) and stronger weapons are only available for soldiers with high ranks. The basic soldier (called Cat Trooper) have no armor and is an easy prey for the bugs. Besides the experience points you gather upgrade points for your equipment for e.g. increase the damage of the weapons. Another aspect of the RPG part is that you can equip each of your soldiers individual with up to two different weapons and two tech-items (like bombs or toxic gas). \n \nThe graphic of the landscape is low on details, everything looks post apocalyptic. Much better is the combat graphic and the explosions. The cutscenes are made with the in-game graphic. Besides the sound effects your soldiers all have a voice to confirm your orders.","collection":4605,"franchise":1051,"franchises":[1051],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25311,76731,68287,71455,11582,19301,25300,36950,19934,9789],"tags":[1,18,268435471,536871882,536874694,536875054,536876220,536881523],"category":0,"keywords":[970,3782,4142,5308,10611],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":975369600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":975369600000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Nov-28","y":2000,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wvgvzk9nzmznb4vuyibk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wvgvzk9nzmznb4vuyibk","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tkjbvh4zwatlcsrtqodr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tkjbvh4zwatlcsrtqodr","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uhpedmof5ytfaxpi4xsc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uhpedmof5ytfaxpi4xsc","width":800,"height":600}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/r7ghchn3alusezqrjm4e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r7ghchn3alusezqrjm4e","width":613,"height":800},"esrb":{"rating":5}},{"id":50924,"name":"Sonic \u0026 Knuckles Collection","slug":"sonic-and-knuckles-collection","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sonic-and-knuckles-collection","created_at":1500057441911,"updated_at":1500462545438,"summary":"A collection including: \n \nSonic the Hedgehog 3 \nSonic \u0026 Knuckles \nSonic 3 \u0026 Knuckles \nBlue Sphere","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":861494400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":861494400000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Apr-20","y":1997,"m":4}]},{"id":50925,"name":"The Ultimate Battle of the Sexes","slug":"the-ultimate-battle-of-the-sexes","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-ultimate-battle-of-the-sexes","created_at":1500057727738,"updated_at":1500403706625,"summary":"The Ultimate Battle of the Sexes is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Neopica and published by Mastertronic, which was released in Europe in 2010.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1327622400000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1327622400000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Jan-27","y":2012,"m":1}]},{"id":50926,"name":"Big League Sports: Summer","slug":"big-league-sports-summer","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/big-league-sports-summer","created_at":1500057729793,"updated_at":1515782085868,"summary":"Put your athletic skills to the test!

You've got to have fast fingers and eyes if you're to grab the cards you need before someone else snatches them from you.","popularity":1.0,"games":[68287,28029,10039,76246,19341,20918,36781,36718,68142,28751],"tags":[1,268435461,268435472,536871066,536871937,536872847,536874083,536875046,536875347],"publishers":[1748],"category":0,"keywords":[154,1025,1935,3171,4134,4435],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,16],"first_release_date":1248048000000,"platforms":[5,56],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":56,"date":1248048000000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Jul-20","y":2009,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1250726400000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Aug-20","y":2009,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gip39lsorkjhwxk0rlow.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gip39lsorkjhwxk0rlow","width":604,"height":420},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/exhdbrcac6luvgvxtdsn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"exhdbrcac6luvgvxtdsn","width":604,"height":420},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rnkzvp73ezocnu4cssf0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rnkzvp73ezocnu4cssf0","width":604,"height":420},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j2dka9wf6vjkq69m7wtt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j2dka9wf6vjkq69m7wtt","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mmb948rmvydevphbrb6o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mmb948rmvydevphbrb6o","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zs0foo2qk3erinkjb86o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zs0foo2qk3erinkjb86o","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/amoyl9juvjfyd2pgitmn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"amoyl9juvjfyd2pgitmn","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mbkpk8wxwxe6zfo2b36q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mbkpk8wxwxe6zfo2b36q","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sk8vii0skrnlpckqjh8a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sk8vii0skrnlpckqjh8a","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ky9rah6zlgnmwdfz2j5m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ky9rah6zlgnmwdfz2j5m","width":640,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yewigxqtubqzetua1hps.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yewigxqtubqzetua1hps","width":100,"height":137},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.left.com"}]},{"id":51088,"name":"Bang Attack","slug":"bang-attack","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bang-attack","created_at":1500060027538,"updated_at":1518048351588,"summary":"Bang Attack is a fun, colorful arcade puzzle game for young and old alike! \n \nBang Attack is a fun, colorful puzzle game for young and old alike!

The game also offers a full-on two player cooperative campaign mode.","popularity":1.0,"games":[68287,28029,76246,10039,19341,32902,68142,27523,28751,36718],"tags":[1,268435461,268435470,536870976,536871937,536875093],"category":0,"keywords":[64,1025,4181],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,14],"first_release_date":1291852800000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1291852800000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Dec-09","y":2010,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/atdkasjgxwrrewqhoe0r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"atdkasjgxwrrewqhoe0r","width":640,"height":908}},{"id":51138,"name":"Puppy Luv: Your New Best Friend","slug":"puppy-luv-your-new-best-friend","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/puppy-luv-your-new-best-friend","created_at":1500061155127,"updated_at":1500403586441,"summary":"Pick out your puppy and begin training him for all the fun he and you are about to have.

Zero: Black-Haired Shrine Maiden) in Japan and Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water in PAL regions, is a survival horror video game developed by Koei Tecmo and published by Nintendo for the Wii U. The fifth main entry in the Fatal Frame series, it was released in Japan in September 2014 and worldwide in October 2015. As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa. \n \nPlanning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning \u0026 Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.","rating":81.0,"popularity":1.0,"total_rating":81.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[23175,37022,55289,42080,59516,44191,12579,25646,25311,1221],"tags":[1,268435487],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1445472000000,"platforms":[41],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1446163200000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Oct-30","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1445472000000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Oct-22","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1448150400000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Nov-22","y":2015,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water (Europe)","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vlpe149l2ywgapmwsa8o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlpe149l2ywgapmwsa8o","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xqstceuwodwgdv35n2xu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xqstceuwodwgdv35n2xu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vf3iojifs2crohwqbdjk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vf3iojifs2crohwqbdjk","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g0mpblhypfew6im61txz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g0mpblhypfew6im61txz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xymx8yrmikuvlp01hgrf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xymx8yrmikuvlp01hgrf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gs9hozp9gyo54npdaya5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gs9hozp9gyo54npdaya5","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fmrqpgjpysnhdoqkbmme.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fmrqpgjpysnhdoqkbmme","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qroylxm0hqkpjfc6wjuw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qroylxm0hqkpjfc6wjuw","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vlf6sx5xmni6kgxf4eif.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlf6sx5xmni6kgxf4eif","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q95psgu29xpvvxyjnmmg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q95psgu29xpvvxyjnmmg","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yfhg4ewrsiq6y7sgf4k1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yfhg4ewrsiq6y7sgf4k1","width":1200,"height":1628},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/4qsfAA8PLHOmOdSgVaRPtG6GMX3OlhCr"}]},{"id":51150,"name":"Bayonetta 2 -

Camera angles can be switched between first-person and third-person options. Characters are improved by gaining levels. A character's level increases after it earns a set amount of experience points through the player versus environment (or \"PvE\") combat and storyline adventures. Characters' abilities are improved by increasing in level, but character skills must be purchased from specified NPCs after gaining a new level. \nThe main storyline (also known as the \"Epic Quest Line\") is presented as a series of \"Books\", which consist of series of quests called \"Chapters\". There were initially eight Books when the game was released, with new books added with each free content update. \nTolkien's Middle-earth as represented in The Lord of the Rings Online implements magic in a different manner than other MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. There are only five \"wizards\" in the fictional world, none of which are player-controlled. Instead, there are active skills which require \"power\" (the equivalent of magic points). Some skills behave like magic (like healing or throwing a burning ember at an enemy), but are based on \"lore\". In addition, objects and artifacts are used to create effects similar to magic. \nOther features include a fast travel system and a detailed quest log with tracker and history.","collection":235,"popularity":1.0,"games":[5602,6,23198,1081,472,125,7346,216,1942,2368],"tags":[268435468,536871059,536871071,536871138,536871139,536871148,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871283,536871421,536871422,536871470,536871504,536871535,536871613,536871670,536871784,536871812,536871931,536871938,536871958,536872015,536872019,536872119,536872205,536872245,536872371,536872462,536872647,536872733,536872810,536872847,536872928,536872978,536873066,536873089,536873297,536873326,536873350,536873351,536873364,536873384,536874134,536874345,536874398,536874813,536875042,536875054,536875095,536875096,536875161,536875169,536875173,536875196,536875199,536875232,536875233,536875241,536875253,536875257,536875265,536875266,536875275,536875286,536875304,536875307,536875311,536875336,536875372,536875380,536875393,536875436,536875455,536875456,536875460,536875464,536875505,536875525,536875610,536875699,536875735,536875738,536875778,536875784,536875790,536875798,536875803,536875855,536875870,536876008,536876084,536876101,536876210,536876232,536876233,536876273,536876286,536876287,536876373,536876492,536876503,536876583,536876606,536876694,536876718,536876991,536877003,536877165,536877208,536877209,536877211,536877275,536877276,536877308,536877562,536877595,536877614,536877739,536877803,536877907,536877992,536878218,536878306,536878314,536878423,536878521,536878524,536879087,536879132,536880004,536880206,536880207,536880421,536880536,536880624,536880753,536880755,536880848,536880863,536881022,536881122,536882034,536882694,536883035,536883101,536883301,536883414,536883419,536883936,536883995,536884018,536884021,536884498,536886200,536886271,536886272,536886710],"category":0,"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[147,159,226,227,236,296,301,332,371,509,510,558,592,623,701,758,872,900,1019,1026,1046,1103,1107,1207,1293,1333,1459,1550,1735,1821,1898,1935,2016,2066,2154,2177,2385,2414,2438,2439,2452,2472,3222,3433,3486,3901,4130,4142,4183,4184,4249,4257,4261,4284,4287,4320,4321,4329,4341,4345,4353,4354,4363,4374,4392,4395,4399,4424,4460,4468,4481,4524,4543,4544,4548,4552,4593,4613,4698,4787,4823,4826,4866,4872,4878,4886,4891,4943,4958,5096,5172,5189,5298,5320,5321,5361,5374,5375,5461,5580,5591,5671,5694,5782,5806,6079,6091,6253,6296,6297,6299,6363,6364,6396,6650,6683,6702,6827,6891,6995,7080,7306,7394,7402,7511,7609,7612,8175,8220,9092,9294,9295,9509,9624,9712,9841,9843,9936,9951,10110,10210,11122,11782,12123,12189,12389,12502,12507,13024,13083,13106,13109,13586,15288,15359,15360,15798],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1179964800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1179964800000,"region":8,"human":"2007-May-24","y":2007,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Lotro","comment":"Other"},{"name":"LotRo:

He created the humans, and the Balaur to safeguard and watch over them. Eventually, the Balaur became obsessed with power and subjugation. Five of the Balaur rose to a height of strength above the rest, and became known as the five Dragon Lords. When Aion refused to grant them the power they desired, the power to rival his own, they revolted and declared war on the god that created them. Aion's hand was forced, and he created the twelve Empyrean Lords, beings of divinity and power to protect the Tower of Eternity. \n \nSome humans \"ascended\" to become Daeva and, like the Empyrean Lords, had wings and the ability to fight the Balaur. With time, enough Daevas rose to form an army. The Empyrean Lords would lead the Daeva into battle and fight ceaselessly. Eventually an attempt at peace with the Balaur was made. The five Drakan Lords were invited inside the barrier for peace talks, but before the peace-talks could begin, one of the Drakan Lords was nearly assassinated by an unknown assailant. In the fighting that followed, the Tower of Eternity was destroyed, resulting in the cataclysm that broke Atreia in half. Five Empyrean Lords, most of whom opposed the peace treaty, came to power in the dark part of the world, \"Asmodae,\" and became known as the Shedim Lords. Another five who had mostly desired peace became the Seraphim Lords and ruled over the lower half of Atreia, \"Elysea.\" Two of the Empyrean Lords sacrificed themselves to keep Atreia from crumbling entirely. \n \nThose that lived in the light part of the world, the Elyos, saw little change. These followers of the Seraphim Lords created the city of Sanctum. The inhabitants of the upper part, the Asmodians, saw many changes. Their hands became claw-like, their feet became talons. The darkness made their complexion cool, and their eyes grew red adapting to the absence of light. They live in the city of Pandaemonium under the rule of the Shedim Lords.","popularity":2.0,"games":[49414,25636,21842,103020,28080,36608,18862,35737,75851,47472],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1261699200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1261699200000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-25","y":2009,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ody3mwqkwlewmtkv9ckb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ody3mwqkwlewmtkv9ckb","width":1668,"height":2362}},{"id":51214,"name":"duplicate Sonic: After the Sequel","slug":"duplicate-sonic-after-the-sequel","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/duplicate-sonic-after-the-sequel","created_at":1500062123446,"updated_at":1500455715719,"summary":"Sonic After the Sequel is an unofficial sequel in the blue hedgehog's franchise that takes place somewhere between Sonic 2 and Sonic 3.

Each player (2 to 6, computer or human) has an army of particles and a cursor. The objective of the game is to assimilate all enemy particles. The players can only move their cursors and cannot directly control the particles. Each particle follows the shortest path around the obstacles to its team's cursor. A player may have several thousands particles at a time, giving the collection of particles a look of a liquid blob. When a particle moves into a particle from a different team, it will fight and if the opponent particle fails to fight back (it is not moving in the opposite direction) it will eventually be assimilated by its attacker. As particles cannot die but only change teams, the total number of particles on the map remains constant. Since a particle can only fight in one direction at a time (towards its team's cursor), a player that surrounds its opponents will have a distinct advantage. The game ends when one player controls all of the particles or when the time runs out. When the time runs out, the player with the most particles wins. \n \nThere are multiple maps which affect the obstacles in the battlefield. These obstacles may affect the strategies of the game. \n \nLiquid War is a multiplayer game and can be played by up to 6 people on one computer, or over the Internet or a LAN. A single player mode is available in which the opponents are controlled by the computer.

It is set up in a classical RPG environment and involves capturing and developing towns, gathering resources, assembling armies and sending them into combat. Each town has a theme and can only raise the type of creatures appropriate to that theme. The resources (gold, wood, ore, gems, crystal, mercury, and sulfur) can be found mostly in mines and are gathered once a day. They are used to build new buildings in your towns, to improve existing buildings, to buy armies, etc. Each army is led by a hero and consists of up to seven stacks of creatures raised in towns or recruited in countryside. The armies are sent into tactical combat, which can occur either in countryside or in towns. If the attacker captures the town, the winner can recruit the creatures raised in that town afterwards. Each game scenario (regular or campaign style) has its own objective which can vary from capturing a specific castle, defeating a specific hero or monster, gathering gold, or finding the Holy Grail.","popularity":1.0,"games":[11362,9760,33603,36962,55888,73075,65827,44591,2015,32283],"tags":[268435471,536872006],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":922579200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":922579200000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Mar-28","y":1999,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gpfez61pmw0lt5l7lggn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gpfez61pmw0lt5l7lggn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/n8xc1mjkayvwglqk5lbs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n8xc1mjkayvwglqk5lbs","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/spvzv3tdzm1luu473fcz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"spvzv3tdzm1luu473fcz","width":1920,"height":1080}]},{"id":51270,"name":"X-Plane 9","slug":"x-plane-9","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/x-plane-9","created_at":1500063144084,"updated_at":1515711313063,"summary":"X-plane 9 Flight Simulator","collection":3692,"popularity":1.0,"games":[3353,715,28465,34919,44242,3352,33603,39755,36962,55888],"tags":[268435469,536870933,536870968,536871904,536873364,536873753,536874140,536876701,536879814,536879815],"category":0,"keywords":[21,56,992,2452,2841,3228,5789,8902,8903],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":1201824000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1201824000000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Feb-01","y":2008,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wpscot48ai5zbcdqeey9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wpscot48ai5zbcdqeey9","width":1614,"height":2251}},{"id":51271,"name":"Railworks 3: Train Simulator 2012","slug":"railworks-3-train-simulator-2012","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/railworks-3-train-simulator-2012","created_at":1500063146433,"updated_at":1515848916053,"summary":"Train Simulator 2012 is the sequel to the award winning RailWorks 2, based on the new TSX game engine®.

The game is the sequel to Soviet Strike and the fifth instalment in the Strike series, which began with Desert Strike on the Sega Genesis. The Soviet Strike development team also created Nuclear Strike. EA released a PC port the same year; THQ developed and in 1999 published a Nintendo 64 version called Nuclear Strike 64. \n \nNuclear Strike is a helicopter-based game, with strategy elements added to the action gameplay. The plot concerns an elite special force - the player's allies - pursuing a nuclear-armed rogue spy through a fictionalised Asian setting. It retained the earlier game's engine but added several modifications to improve graphical performance and make the game more accessible. The game features 15 playable vehicles, a large increase from previous games. In addition to the main fictionalised Apache, there are secondary helicopters, jets, armour and a hovercraft. The player also commands ground troops in occasional real-time strategy sections. \n \nThe game received positive, negative and mixed reviews. Critics noted a weak storyline, though GameSpot dismissed this is as unimportant in an action game. GameSpot called the graphics - which made use of specialised hardware such as 3Dfx Voodoo video cards and the N64 Expansion Pak - \"about as good as it gets\", while Allgame said they are \"decent\" and Daily Radar called them \"horrible\". Critics praised the full motion video as well as the music and sound effects. Reviewers enjoyed the straightforward gameplay but several complained of a close similarity to its predecessor Soviet Strike and questioned the game's value as a result.","collection":5029,"popularity":1.0,"games":[28751,54539,848,665,74161,18088,11171,302,4368,7843],"tags":[1,536870913,536870933,536870937,536871213,536873999,536874539,536874743,536875171,536875309,536875361,536875426,536875688,536876378,536876412,536876990,536878439,536880233,536880441,536881200,536883622,536883633,536884031,536884033],"category":0,"keywords":[1,21,25,301,3087,3627,3831,4259,4397,4449,4514,4776,5466,5500,6078,7527,9321,9529,10288,12710,12721,13119,13121],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":880934400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":880934400000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Dec-01","y":1997,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rzwfw05sfrsncq507mat.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rzwfw05sfrsncq507mat","width":640,"height":640},"esrb":{"rating":5}},{"id":51275,"name":"CrossFire AL","slug":"crossfire-al","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crossfire-al","created_at":1500063190678,"updated_at":1500459302828,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1235952000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1235952000000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Mar-02","y":2009,"m":3}]},{"id":51276,"name":"FreeJack","slug":"freejack","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/freejack","created_at":1500063195270,"updated_at":1500457909503,"popularity":1.0,"category":0,"first_release_date":1388534400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1388534400000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jan-01","y":2014,"m":1}]},{"id":51277,"name":"BOFH: Servers Under Siege","slug":"bofh-servers-under-siege","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bofh-servers-under-siege","created_at":1500063196386,"updated_at":1500457936774,"summary":"A group of insane activists called the \"Internet Salvation Force\" has invaded a school, taking all servers and workstations as hostages.

Snowblind Studios is in the unique position of drawing inspiration from both the literary and film rights to world of Middle-earth, allowing players to bloody their axes on a wide range of deadly enemies and traverse both established and never-before-seen locations. The result is a journey that is both epic and intimate, familiar yet unexpected. \n \nACTION MEETS RPG \nIntense, visceral, and satisfying combat. Rich, layered, and impactful character progression. In War in the North, you get both. Find and equip the best loot, upgrade your hero using a wide range of skills and items, and feel the intense satisfaction of rushing into real-time battles with friends by your side. Fight through the brutal realities of the war on all fronts that were brought to life in the lore. Immerse yourself and make your own mark on Middle-earth. \n \n \nCO-OP AT ITS CORE \nBuild your own fellowship of three heroes to confront the growing army in the North. The survival of your group and all of Middle-earth depends upon your uniquely skilled heroes working together. You must fight together or you will die alone, and these high stakes make the experience of playing together both socially engaging and incredibly satisfying. The first time you rescue a friend who has been grabbed by a troll and is desperately yelling for help, you will understand what we mean. \n \n \nAN UNTOLD STORY \n While much attention and focus has been placed on the journey of the One Ring, the assault on Middle-earth hits all corners of the map. War in the North turns our attention towards an integral part of the storyline that is grounded in details within the books and various appendices. This is not someone else’s fight. This is your own effort to forage a way through the dark, dangerous, and unknown landscape, defending all that is yours.

In the game the player, as Santa Claus, attempts to knock down elves who are arranged like bowling pins.[1] A later release of the game on Nintendo handheld consoles Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance was universally panned by critics \n \n \nIn Elf Bowling, Santa Claus gets revenge on his striking elves by using them as bowling pins. \n \nDuring the game, the elves say phrases such as \"Is that all the balls you got, Santa?\" when the player misses their first spare opportunity or \"Gutter ball!\" in a silly-sounding voice when a ball is rolled into the gutter. Other potential distractions for the user are a deer that walks up along the bowling lane that can be \"hit\" with the bowling ball if the arrow is positioned to the far left, and a frog wearing a Santa hat hopping back and forth across the player's field of vision (resembling Kalvin Kroaker from Frogapult, also made by Nstorm). If one hits the frog with the bowling ball, his body is hauled away from the screen by a bird from Frogapult. A white rabbit also jumps and defecates across the bowling lane.

An unknown being who calls himself the Guardian claims that Britannia has entered a true age of enlightenment, and soon everyone, including the Avatar himself, shall bow before the new lord. At this moment, a moongate materializes, and the Avatar steps through it into Britannia. He emerges in the city of Trinsic, where his old friend Iolo tells him that two hundred years have passed since his last visit. A horrible ritualistic murder has just occurred - the body of the local blacksmith was found in the stables. The Avatar learns that a new organization known as the Fellowship has been recruiting more and more followers recently. The champion of Britannia must solve the murder and find out about the Fellowship's true purpose, while still pursued by the ominous warnings of the mysterious Guardian. \n \nUltima VII: The Black Gate features revamped graphics and controls. The traditional Ultima top-down view of the world now fills the entire screen, with other informational windows overlaid on top of it only when necessary. Both world interaction and dialogue are fully mouse-controlled. Objects can be physically interacted with by dragging them with the mouse. Objects can also be stacked upon each other, and some puzzles are based on this feature. Equipment screen utilizes a \"paper doll\" concept: equipped items are graphically displayed on the character. It is also possible to physically manipulate inventory items, arranging them within bags and other containers. \n \nThe tactical combat system of previous Ultima games has been replaced with a real-time system where only general strategies can be set and party members fight automatically, the player taking control of the Avatar alone. Combat pauses when the player accesses the inventory. Leveling up system is similar to the previous games, the Avatar's parameters increasing automatically once a sufficient amount of experience points has been accumulated. The Avatar and his companions must regularly eat in order to stay alive. \n \nThe game's world is vast, populated by many non-playable characters with their own schedules. There are more extensive dialogue trees and individual conversation topics compared to the series' previous installments. As in the earlier Ultima games, the player is free to explore Britannia from the beginning of the game; certain tasks must be accomplished in a specific order to conclude the story.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,36608,21842,28080,75102,44591,18862,16468,19567],"tags":[268435468,536872006],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":705974400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":705974400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-May-16","y":1992,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vg02qwplqeevgq9ogdwl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vg02qwplqeevgq9ogdwl","width":1000,"height":1394}},{"id":51353,"name":"Hearts","slug":"hearts","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hearts","created_at":1500065069175,"updated_at":1516562394560,"summary":"A card game.","popularity":1.0,"games":[60693,31559,79215,70418,67995,63236,13196,25554,82268,80694],"tags":[268435472,536874083,536875182],"category":0,"keywords":[3171,4270],"genres":[16],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Hearts for Windows","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qsomillhda4f7rjrq7o7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qsomillhda4f7rjrq7o7","width":300,"height":300}},{"id":51354,"name":"Freecell","slug":"freecell","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/freecell","created_at":1500065071487,"updated_at":1517270968970,"summary":"A card game","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76731,29173,55036,932,21417,23345,26391,55590,19376,60693],"tags":[268435471,268435472,536872287,536874083,536874694,536875182],"category":0,"keywords":[1375,3171,3782,4270],"genres":[15,16],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y4c904xnqu8nqxno1rxx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y4c904xnqu8nqxno1rxx","width":749,"height":1060}},{"id":51355,"name":"CrossFire Europe","slug":"crossfire-europe","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crossfire-europe","created_at":1500065073559,"updated_at":1500458678361,"popularity":1.0,"category":0,"first_release_date":1367366400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1367366400000,"region":8,"human":"2013-May-01","y":2013,"m":5}]},{"id":51356,"name":"Shattered Suns","slug":"shattered-suns","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shattered-suns","created_at":1500065287960,"updated_at":1500461902948,"summary":"One brave captain defies an empire as billions hunger for liberty.

Only one item can be carried at a time, so picking up one item means leaving behind of whatever item is currently being carried. Some screens have interactive sub elements. For example: you could \"climb\" Pooh's tree and see the limb where he kept his honey pots safely out of the reach of flood waters (a reference to a scene in the Disney animated movie \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\"and Chapter 9 of A.A. Milne's book Winnie-the-Pooh.). The game has no animation in the mode of a traditional Quest game such as King's Quest. Rather, the Hundred Acre Wood existed as a grid of connected static screens. Players move between the screen using the arrow keys and can only move North, South, East or West. The missing items are randomly assigned at the start of each new game to screens within this grid, although the various characters can always be found on the same screens. When an item is \"dropped\" on a screen in order to \"pick up\" another item, the dropped item stays on that screen until the user returns to retrieve it later. \nReuniting a character with their item results in a celebration screen.","collection":2986,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,22425,25222,41895,55803,26766,47823,36926,11296,19289],"tags":[268435487,536871208,536871939,536872475,536875054,536875078,536875243,536875291,536875292,536877280,536881400],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1027,1563,4142,4166,4331,4379,4380,6368,10488],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":507600000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":507600000000,"region":8,"human":"1986-Feb-01","y":1986,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/onp0xarhxnzjafbpabf1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"onp0xarhxnzjafbpabf1","width":350,"height":418}},{"id":51371,"name":"Space Bunnies Must Die!","slug":"space-bunnies-must-die","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/space-bunnies-must-die","created_at":1500065349553,"updated_at":1515663224158,"summary":"Space Bunnies Must Die! is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Ripcord Games and released on October 31, 1998 by Jinx for Microsoft Windows 98.
