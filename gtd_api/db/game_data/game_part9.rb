is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of Duke Nukem on a mission to save Earth from an alien invasion. Players use pistols, machine guns, rocket launchers, and shrink rays to kill aliens and mutant enemies in frenetic combat. Firefights are accompanied by realistic gunfire, large explosions, and blood-splatter effects. Enemies occasionally break apart into bloody fragments as they are killed. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: an alien decapitated by a shotgun blast; an alien's head ripped from its body. The game includes some sexual/suggestive material: depictions of topless women and/or women with tassels on their breasts; dialogue stating “Spank me, spank me” and “Come back to bed, Duke, I'm ready for some action now\"; sexual moaning sounds. One mission area depicts a marijuana farm in Amsterdam; smoking from a hookah in this area causes players' character to hallucinate (i.e., screen-warping effects). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in dialogue.

Will is an archaeology student, complete with an experienced mentor (Dr. Richard Headstrong,) good build, average looks and a smoking hot girlfriend (Emma) who is also the daughter of his mentor. But when a seemingly uneventful dig takes a turn for the worse, Will is forced into becoming a one-man army against a fanatic cult known as the Olympian Restoration Army (ORA) who have found a way to bring back Zeus and a boatload of mythological beings from ancient Greece (who all really existed, evidently.) \n \nThe ORA then murder Richard, and abduct Emma as a mortal bride for Zeus so that he can gain complete power over the mortal world which, unsurprisingly, drives Will over the edge and leaves him in a rather unpleasant position. Luckily for Will the Titan god Prometheus, who happens to be in the market for recruits to destroy Zeus, was close by. With similar goals in mind, Prometheus imbues Will with power leaving him half-man, half-titan - perfect for Will to exact his revenge and rescue his damsel in distress. Locked, loaded and possessed the player is left to control Will as he storms the lost city of Olympus without fear of the terrors within...","rating":86.01733482419469,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":67.0,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":76.50866741209734,"total_rating_count":8,"rating_count":6,"games":[7351,23188,12597,529,549,19531,11118,231,551,499],"tags":[1,17,268435461,536870947,536871010,536871041,536871082,536871208,536871365,536871409,536871470,536871865,536871931,536872140,536872232,536872257,536873053,536873383,536873454,536873863,536873949,536873999,536874398,536874743,536874947,536875073,536875081,536875083,536875097,536875199,536875209,536875242,536875271,536875308,536875319,536875442,536875452,536875483,536875491,536875524,536875571,536875572,536875573,536875597,536875606,536875609,536875639,536875671,536875740,536875744,536875745,536875792,536875804,536875807,536875814,536875891,536875903,536875941,536876010,536876029,536876030,536876031,536876057,536876261,536876315,536876333,536876446,536876572,536876619,536876687,536876706,536876711,536876879,536876947,536877161,536877287,536877407,536877422,536877452,536877502,536877537,536877567,536877570,536877630,536877713,536877954,536877976,536878070,536878317,536878354,536878448,536878480,536878481,536878514,536878553,536878597,536879020,536879758,536879906,536879907,536880264,536880292,536880346,536880365,536880625,536880633,536880880,536880959,536881235,536881311,536881456,536881534,536881535,536882084,536883936,1073741825],"developers":[946],"publishers":[7041],"game_engines":[452],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[35,98,129,170,296,453,497,558,953,1019,1228,1320,1345,2141,2471,2542,2951,3037,3087,3486,3831,4035,4161,4169,4171,4185,4287,4297,4330,4359,4396,4407,4530,4540,4571,4579,4612,4659,4660,4661,4685,4694,4697,4727,4759,4828,4832,4833,4880,4892,4895,4902,4979,4991,5029,5098,5117,5118,5119,5145,5349,5403,5421,5534,5660,5707,5775,5794,5799,5967,6035,6249,6375,6495,6510,6540,6590,6625,6655,6658,6718,6801,7042,7064,7158,7405,7442,7536,7568,7569,7602,7641,7685,8108,8846,8994,8995,9352,9380,9434,9453,9713,9721,9968,10047,10323,10399,10544,10622,10623,11172,13024],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1055116800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1055462400000,"region":1,"human":"2003-Jun-13","y":2003,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1055116800000,"region":2,"human":"2003-Jun-09","y":2003,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dujv75ogxnscqbhhvmhc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dujv75ogxnscqbhhvmhc","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ex3lsowzgvuo3fh8iiqi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ex3lsowzgvuo3fh8iiqi","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yx4rub7jj25vdv64qc0j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yx4rub7jj25vdv64qc0j","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i5eyig9roy3tiaixlsmd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i5eyig9roy3tiaixlsmd","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q3we9xhyjj2peardfw9h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q3we9xhyjj2peardfw9h","width":800,"height":600}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"VeOZkyYZIns"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"oLReun9Uz3k"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wcaf2gxv8dcofkmmyqqy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wcaf2gxv8dcofkmmyqqy","width":1423,"height":1411},"esrb":{"rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rock"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":23718,"name":"Fire ProWrestling Z","slug":"fire-prowrestling-z","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fire-prowrestling-z","created_at":1473197993664,"updated_at":1473198013639,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":82.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":82.0,"total_rating_count":1,"category":0},{"id":23719,"name":"Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition","slug":"neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition","created_at":1473198042770,"updated_at":1526292052796,"summary":"Return to the Forgotten Realms in this bestselling Dungeons \u0026 Dragons roleplaying game.

Following the disappearance of the Defender of the Universe, the Galactic Presidency has been dissolved and anarchy reigns. With the galaxy divided into three distinct zones, the Galactic Police and the Culthorpe pirate family are engaged in a cold war from across the Lifeless Zone.

And to make matters worse, an invisible conspiracy is threatening life itself.\n\nNone of which means anything to Daniel Gordon, earthling and wage slave, whose major concern is keeping hold of his pension plan. That is until he is unexpectedly abducted by the galaxy's premier employment agency and finds himself stuck with a crew of misfit mercenaries on a cargo transporter built more like a skip with thrusters.

In Grim Legions, you control units that move around the map trying to capture towns. Each turn, the towns recruit more units. The aim of the game is simply to wipe out your enemy (destroy all their troops and capture all their towns). There can be up to 4 players, and you can make alliances with other players.\n\nThere are three different types of troop: infantry, archers and cavalry. There's not much difference between these types, archers are just better than infantry, and cavalry better than archers. Unlike a lot of other games, you can combine multiple troop types in one unit (or \"legion\"), and you can split and merge them as much as you like.\n\nMap generation is randomized, but you have a lot of control over it. E.g. if you get sick of your units taking ages to move through the mountains, you can just generate a map without mountains. You can also decide how much of the map you want to be water (which no troops can move through), from 0% to 60%. There are also 3 map sizes to choose from. This means - despite the relatively simple gameplay - there are quite a few different scenarios. You can end up spending a lot more time playing this game than you think!\n\nGrim Legions is currently in open beta. You can download it for Windows or Linux, or play the web-based version (which uses WebGL)","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13196,27209,16468,932,26268,26391,77176,19698,36792,1513],"tags":[17,268435472,536871200,536873247,1073741827],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[288,2335],"themes":[17],"genres":[16],"first_release_date":1473379200000,"status":3,"platforms":[6,82,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1473379200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-09","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1473379200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-09","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":82,"date":1473379200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-09","y":2016,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/elgiqaeugtrb70yhi0ad.jpg","cloudinary_id":"elgiqaeugtrb70yhi0ad","width":459,"height":391},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pjkoaegn4kqwuur8dj03.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pjkoaegn4kqwuur8dj03","width":509,"height":379},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uzyw08qysgt6tuzra1zf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uzyw08qysgt6tuzra1zf","width":368,"height":472},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aiqdjelonpruu83qijgd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aiqdjelonpruu83qijgd","width":546,"height":307}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jr2qrelmqzluzvkq0trs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jr2qrelmqzluzvkq0trs","width":378,"height":490},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://grim-legions.zeefin.net/"}]},{"id":23843,"name":"Crackpots","slug":"crackpots","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/crackpots","created_at":1473389070866,"updated_at":1517271030902,"summary":"We're infested!

Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me; the craft having been completely destroyed. \n \nThe place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.

Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines. \n \nDuring this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.

To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.","collection":2457,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36868,44177,51485,26848,11588,55752,41064,76098,67034,65980],"tags":[27,268435464,268435466,268435489,536871262,536872961,1073741826],"developers":[366],"publishers":[366],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[350,2049],"themes":[27],"genres":[8,10,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[68,65,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":68,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jtwz30igywuw7kwnxpqt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jtwz30igywuw7kwnxpqt","width":1000,"height":1521}},{"id":23878,"name":"Zhombre, The Undead Hombre","slug":"zhombre-the-undead-hombre","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zhombre-the-undead-hombre","created_at":1473649501048,"updated_at":1473683135311,"summary":"Zhombre, The Undead Hombre is an Action Platformer set in a post apocalyptic world 100 years after the zombie invasion.

It will unfold in episodes, giving players the opportunity to continue to unravel a complex mystery through downloadable content that picks up where the previous episode’s cliffhanger left off.\n\nIt is scheduled for release on both PC and console platforms.\n\nEpisode One follows an indie film crew who travels to Shady Hollow to produce a documentary on John Beaumont and the disappearance of the 2 miners. In 1975 John was accused and convicted of murdering two coal miners. During the investigation, John claimed it was the Hollow Creek Witch responsible for the disappearance of the miners.\n\nPlayers take on the role of Eddie, a character with a checkered past who has psychic abilities that allows him to see things from the past while touching items found throughout the game.

She was betrayed by the one person she cared for the most, Rev James Beaumont. Little did he know the terror he was about to unleash upon the small town of Shady Hollow.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until the 1940’s before the Beaumont family would return to Shady Hollow. Cliff and Linda Beaumont along with their children Sally and John moved to Shady Hollow to open a coal mining operation. The woods outside of Shady Hollow were known to be rich with coal, and being in the coal business, the Beaumonts’ saw this as a great opportunity.\n\nSeveral months after their arrival, their daughter Sally went missing. For weeks, the towns people searched the woods and the coal mines but all they would find is a shoe belonging to Sally by the Hollow Creek. Most believed that Sally must have fallen into the creek and drowned while others believed it was the curse of The Hollow Creek Witch.\n\nA year later, both Cliff and Linda Beaumont grew ill and soon died. It was rumored that the loss of their daughter was too much for them to handle. John, being the sole remaining member of the Beaumont family was taken to an orphanage.\n\nAbout thirty five years later (1975), John, now a grown man was approached by another mining company looking to buy the rights to the Beaumont Coal Company. The coal company was abandoned after the death of his parents so John agreed to sell his share of the company. On the morning of March 15th, 1975, John and two miners would travel through the woods to take mineral samples at one of the more lucrative mining sites in Shady Hollow. John would be the only person to return from that trip.\n\nAfter several searches, the two miners were found. What the police saw would haunt them the rest of their lives. John Beaumont was immediately arrested for the murders and spent his remaining days in the Shady Hollow Mental Hospital.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, 5 indie film makers travel to Shady Hollow to do a documentary about the disappearance of the two miners in 1975 and the Beaumont family. After arriving, they soon find out that the townspeople of Shady Hollow don’t welcome outsiders and are resistant to speak about the troubled past of the town. They soon begin to uncover the urban legend of the Hollow Creek Witch that haunts the woods surrounding Shady Hollow.","collection":2429,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,72412,55289,13189,25646,25311,26145,26163,76122,74378],"tags":[19,268435468,268435487,268435488,1073741825],"developers":[10892],"publishers":[10892],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[19],"genres":[12,31,32],"first_release_date":1509321600000,"status":4,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1509321600000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Oct-30","y":2017,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w3tavk8ticklsrid6jvr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w3tavk8ticklsrid6jvr","width":1604,"height":1056},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hgkwwkmyhdlzfivboms5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hgkwwkmyhdlzfivboms5","width":1604,"height":1056},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d9rjykqkbkfs9photwx5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d9rjykqkbkfs9photwx5","width":1604,"height":1056},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vompvehwv0wvimwmnmol.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vompvehwv0wvimwmnmol","width":1604,"height":1056},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qvgsiroi0ktmyklwaqo8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qvgsiroi0ktmyklwaqo8","width":1604,"height":1056}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gmmrimqymz28qmuvmttp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gmmrimqymz28qmuvmttp","width":1677,"height":1300},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/554550"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.enyxstudios.com"}],"external":{"steam":"554550"}},{"id":23884,"name":"I Wish You Rain","slug":"i-wish-you-rain","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/i-wish-you-rain","created_at":1473692671017,"updated_at":1504193193346,"summary":"Dark 3D (1-axis camera) platformer - beat-em-up with profound fighting system and unusual graphics.","storyline":"Protagonist's father was killed because he loved to watch raindrops on the river disrespectfully close to the rival's territory.

Before you start the game, you can access the options screen which lets you customize the screen to include another player, turn off the sound or the scene music, or let either player start at any particular level.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[55752,51485,23175,26848,59516,36868,55289,37022,1070,25646],"tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536872961,536875073,536875686,1073741828],"developers":[32],"publishers":[10329,32],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[2049,4161,4774],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[68,75,152,125,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":152,"date":504835200000,"region":5,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":125,"date":504835200000,"region":5,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":68,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ctkwfg9xzwkp3sltpjm4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ctkwfg9xzwkp3sltpjm4","width":1000,"height":1372}},{"id":23886,"name":"Arachnoid","slug":"arachnoid","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/arachnoid","created_at":1473699622570,"updated_at":1517270536663,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,32902,10039,68287,68142,28751,36794,24920],"tags":[1,268435461,268435489,1073741827],"publishers":[10894],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[71],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":71,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y4cgdzzfaeb54no2pazu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y4cgdzzfaeb54no2pazu","width":1000,"height":1463}},{"id":23887,"name":"Squish 'em","slug":"squish-em","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/squish-em","created_at":1473700566358,"updated_at":1515593342613,"summary":"A action game written by Tony Ngo that was published for various 8-bit platforms.

As you are the lead operative in a shadowy government organization, you’ll be travelling back in time completing different missions and objectives. Every mission is unique, and you could be doing anything from analyzing an event, to actually messing around with them and changing the past! (WOO HOO, Lottery number here I come!) \n\nAs any time travel game worth its flux capacitor, the things you change in the past, will undoubtedly mess with the present, and you can never really be sure how it’s going to work out for you. Nothing is ever that simple, and it is in that which we build our story! \n\nSo who are you? \nLead operative - has specifically been chosen for this job, you might even say you were ‘born for it’. From the moment the kind hearted genius Mr. Greenvill adopted you, you’ve been groomed for this position. You are completely untraceable, you’re basically a ghost, who better to send back and forth in time after all, than someone who could be over looked. \n\nWhat do we have for you? \nWe’ve used a low poly art style for the game along with appropriately captivating colors. The UI will also be built around the same low poly style. It’s time travel after all, let’s have some nostalgia! Please note the videos and images are current, a work in progress and not representative of the final product. Entirely isometric view for the game play but we switch it up with dynamic camera angles to keep things interesting during our cinematic sequences before every mission. \n\nAs mentioned before, that the game play is mission based and the story runs in a linear frame, there is however lots to explore in and out of missions. During the missions, you will be exploring the given scenario; you’ll be interacting with people in the past, as well as occasionally using stealth to avoid situations, all to achieve your objectives. We figure it will run around 2-4 hours of game play, in addition to three extra ‘present’ missions which draw you further into the It’s TIME story, as you feel and experience your work in the past, reflected. \n\nThe “It’s TIME” Team \nWe’re a bunch of passionate geeks; coders, designers, artists, musicians and overly talkative voice actors. Our studio setup is based out of India, but many of us come from around the globe, all to make our first big hit! We’ve been working on the story, game play prototype and mission concepts for what seem like ages now, and we’re ready to hit the ground running as soon as our crowd funding campaign comes to a close, we just want to bring you along for the ride too!. \n\nRelease \nInitial plans are for PC, Mac, Linux and Steam (if we are lucky enough to get your support for greenlight). We also have plans for Android and IOS in the future. Release date will be around 1 year from the campaign. \n\nBefore we go… \nAs one last note we’d like to leave for you; if there is anything you think you’d like to suggest or even change in our vision for “It’s TIME”, please feel free to leave us a comment here, or visit our website to do the same. This is why we’re asking you, we want you to be happy with what we create together. If you like what you see above kindly support us on steam and also back us on the campaign to get this game professionally done. Now is the time to make this idea a reality, and we can only do it with your help, so don’t hesitate to contact us; because It’s TIME!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741826],"game_engines":[13,385],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[117,481,503,1027,1141,1158,1416,2579,2580,2751,2752],"themes":[18,20,22,23,31,43],"genres":[2,9,31],"first_release_date":1517356800000,"status":4,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[6,92,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1517356800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jan-31","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1517356800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jan-31","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1517356800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jan-31","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1517356800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jan-31","y":2018,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eayuwaddnn7anww2lwze.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eayuwaddnn7anww2lwze","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/grka7l0laa3cmfseni7t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"grka7l0laa3cmfseni7t","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/onyzpzjkphbcuwxrqowr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"onyzpzjkphbcuwxrqowr","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/banc8gtqeog0rr7meopo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"banc8gtqeog0rr7meopo","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zpil2byirnd3dcx4zwck.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zpil2byirnd3dcx4zwck","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"qeC1ndJYdMw"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"feA2wObD5io"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"PftxcfnHAFE"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uzd2c6jtk5klggto6d9g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uzd2c6jtk5klggto6d9g","width":1024,"height":1024},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":2},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.yellowstargames.com/"}]},{"id":23889,"name":"Shamus: Case II","slug":"shamus-case-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shamus-case-ii","created_at":1473703855302,"updated_at":1527965834639,"collection":2430,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36794,36608,34919,51485,22819,40524,51683,24199,23175,16468],"tags":[1,268435489,1073741828],"developers":[9466],"publishers":[9466],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[65,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Shamus: Case 2","comment":"Other"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"CO8XHDGSxoE"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"XLvpDC728OI"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iozlqijy2vrtunpdyat2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iozlqijy2vrtunpdyat2","width":1000,"height":1415}},{"id":23890,"name":"Mr. Cool","slug":"mr-cool","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mr-cool","created_at":1473704422476,"updated_at":1513002554207,"summary":"Players hop around a pyramid of plates to change their colors in this Q*Bert-inspired game from Sierra.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[51485,10039,24199,1070,55752,26848,36868,42611,37094,1073],"tags":[1,268435464,268435489,536872611,536872617,536875074,536875168,536875822,536875870,536876005,536876008,536876069,536876120,1073741826],"developers":[32],"publishers":[32],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1699,1705,4162,4256,4910,4958,5093,5096,5157,5208],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[13,65,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhjjutrzmvw0i4vperuz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fhjjutrzmvw0i4vperuz","width":1000,"height":1351}},{"id":23891,"name":"Daymare: 1998","slug":"daymare-1998","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/daymare-1998","created_at":1473710326104,"updated_at":1489279549473,"summary":"Daymare: 1998 is a third person survival horror game with over the shoulder camera, developed in Unreal Engine 4 for Windows PC.

If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game. \n \nYou start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level. \n \nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town. \n \nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[29173,25311,9789,55590,65832,19301,76731,11582,19934,23345],"tags":[1,18,27,268435469,268435471,268435480,536871262,536871882,536871906,536872552,536873089,536874694,536875245,536875710,536876282,536880536,1073741827],"developers":[5125],"publishers":[341,1,489,2391],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[350,970,994,1640,2177,3782,4333,4798,5370,9624],"themes":[1,18,27],"genres":[13,15,24],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[13,65,125,15,77,18,27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":77,"date":586396800000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Aug-01","y":1988,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":125,"date":562723200000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Nov-01","y":1987,"m":11},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":599529600000,"region":5,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":654652800000,"region":2,"human":"1990-Sep-30","y":1990,"m":9},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MULE","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zz7uuhk2iq5ilhrifwu5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zz7uuhk2iq5ilhrifwu5","width":1000,"height":975}},{"id":23896,"name":"Legacy","slug":"legacy","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/legacy","created_at":1473716779814,"updated_at":1516633413961,"summary":"Legacy is a Third Person Shooter-Adventure and Puzzle solving Game made by one person.\n\nThe story of the game is still in progress and it will be revealed and updated in future posts.

The second wave of exiles changed that.\n\nIn the months following the last war thousands of humans from the Solar system fled to Gemini, seeking refuge from the A’Shriari aliens. They were not greeted with joy. Instead they were sent to a barely habitable planet in the outer Gemini region called Phaehana. There they built for themselves at least some sort of a meager existence. They call themselves the Solari Concord, casting away any connection to the hated empire, but at the same time honoring their Earthly heritage. Thousands more joined them on the planet of Phaeneros. It was time to think ahead and carve a place for themselves among the twin suns of Gemini.","collection":1193,"franchise":862,"franchises":[862],"rating":80.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":46.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":63.0,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":2,"games":[25300,19301,25311,11582,9789,23212,19934,8773,24048,29173],"tags":[1,18,33,38,39,41,268435467,268435468,268435469,268435471,268435480,268435488,536870936,536870963,536871416,536871859,536871882,536871886,536871938,536872634,536873019,536874694,536875378,1073741825,1073741828,1073741826],"developers":[5206],"publishers":[5206,2776],"game_engines":[386],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2,4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[24,51,504,947,970,974,1026,1722,2107,3782,4466],"themes":[1,18,33,38,39,41],"genres":[11,12,13,15,24,32],"first_release_date":1495497600000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[6,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1518134400000,"region":2,"human":"2018-Feb-09","y":2018,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1518134400000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Feb-09","y":2018,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1495497600000,"region":8,"human":"2017-May-23","y":2017,"m":5}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nuuzaavaem73ag1wuh5y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nuuzaavaem73ag1wuh5y","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kb4czctlquafxjpvvelv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kb4czctlquafxjpvvelv","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ojldpq47xi84rorwyzyo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ojldpq47xi84rorwyzyo","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nyhw59h2h5ypv2xy8tgf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nyhw59h2h5ypv2xy8tgf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mq8tsagav1xr9dmqi3en.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mq8tsagav1xr9dmqi3en","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"AjOffon0thY"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ot29dtuvygcbvqss7le4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ot29dtuvygcbvqss7le4","width":1920,"height":1080},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Violence that is not shown but is implied","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starpoint_Gemini_Warlords"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/419480"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.starpointgemini.com"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/StarpointGemini"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/starpointgemini"}],"external":{"steam":"419480"}},{"id":23906,"name":"Reset","slug":"reset--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/reset--1","created_at":1473755907912,"updated_at":1534677309888,"summary":"Reset is a single player co-op first person puzzle game with a strong emphasis on story and atmosphere.

Players interact with townspeople, undertake missions, and engage in turn-based battles with enemies (e.g., zombies, demons, humans). Damage is indicated by a hit animation (i.e., the character taking damage will rock backwards), with a numerical value popping up to show the magnitude of the health/hit points depleted from the attack. One monster is called “bloody hand” and is depicted as a small hand covered in red liquid. A few scenes contain moderately suggestive dialogue: “Gah, when I heard it was mixed bathing, I had all kinds of wild ideas, but this is…well, a bit dull. . .;” “If Lavender and Carraway can have their carry-on, why can't we?” One level allows players to wager in-game currency on slot machines and poker hands. Bathroom humor also occurs in the game: references to manure; vomit sounds; urine jokes (e.g.,\"Phew! I made it to the wall just in time!\"). During the course of the game, townsfolk are sometimes depicted or described as drunk (e.g., “That there soldier may be drunk as a skunk, but he can still cut a rug!”; a shopkeeper hiccups and and slurs his speech.). The words “damn” and “hell” appear in the dialogue.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Content that teaches or encourages gambling","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://dragonquest7.nintendo.com/"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_VII"},{"category":2,"url":"http://dragonquest.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Quest_VII"}]},{"id":23914,"name":"ARAYA","slug":"araya","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/araya","created_at":1473774557225,"updated_at":1523393254847,"summary":"ARAYA is a first person horror game.

A first person desktop game filled with adventure, discovery and combat.\n\nBlue Horizon has been created so the player is in a large open world environment. With each part of the game although separate can be explored without the player noticing.\n\nCaribbean World\nThere is only one level. Always viewable on the horizon. Initially consisting of 8 Islands, the player must discover each location in order to explore it. Locations can be discovered by talking to NPCs (Non-Playable characters), or following maps found. Once a location has been found it can be traveled to and from using a ship.\n\nTropical Islands with towns, villages, forts, dunes, mountains, cave systems, giant caverns, ship wrecks, and forests all lay in wait for the player to find and explore.\n\nInventory and Items\nWeapons, equipment, books, valuable loot are found laying around, in containers or purchased from shops and peddlers, looted from enemies, or given as rewards for completing tasks previously given. Keys are required for some doors too.\nWeapons are currently melee, pistols and cannon emplacements.\n\nEquipment or a pistol can also be equipped in the left hand such as the Lantern for seeing in dark caves. Provisions are needed to restore health, enhancement items can also be found or purchased.\n\nTasks\nTo progress, one must complete tasks given from NPCs or from instructions found. The NPCs will be grateful, whether they are for the main quest or side missions. Tasks may involve collecting, farming, building, hunting, slaying or completing another task. Hidden stashes, and Bounty hunting are available from NPCs.\n\nEnemies\nThere are dangerous islands, and relatively safe islands. Unique foes await, be they Pirates, animals or strange creatures, undead and non-human. Some enemies are weak, some are strong and have various short and long range attacks. Some individuals you encounter will be docile until provoked, in which case they may attack as a group.\n\nEnemy ships can plague the player too. Captain Bloodbeard's ship is the main aggressor. Bosses await to complete the main story line. The seas contain Marauding Pirate ships which you may encounter when sailing from Island to Island.\nThe game is still in development and is being expanded to give the player the most enjoyment and fun as possible, while making it not too easy or too hard.","rating":50.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":50.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[47823,25300,36926,55289,25311,55092,16468,26766,22747,37088],"tags":[1,22,268435468,268435487,268435488,536871063,536871208,536871938,536871945,536875352],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[151,296,1026,1033,4440],"themes":[1,22],"genres":[12,31,32],"first_release_date":1503014400000,"status":2,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1503014400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Aug-18","y":2017,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l4jk8bmwrzlob8jxtlr3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l4jk8bmwrzlob8jxtlr3","width":1604,"height":900},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j8qgi8jyv8mzeskjqkeb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j8qgi8jyv8mzeskjqkeb","width":1615,"height":909},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/y35ad6tgscohpe279hwo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y35ad6tgscohpe279hwo","width":1615,"height":905},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jowk4to6abrezgjoop1a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jowk4to6abrezgjoop1a","width":1403,"height":787},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/weihzwieodwyxxrwe8sq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"weihzwieodwyxxrwe8sq","width":1614,"height":907}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ffdchs2nx6hs0crl9n4l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ffdchs2nx6hs0crl9n4l","width":1016,"height":908},"external":{"steam":"589740"}},{"id":23931,"name":"Dallas

Shall we play a game? \n \nThis strategic game is based on the popular 1983 movie of the same name, starring Matthew Broderick. It might remind people of Missile Command but the action is slower and spread over six screens which represent different areas of the U.S.A. Enemy missiles, planes, and subs will attack and you must direct your own forces, which include missiles, planes, subs, and satellites, to intercept them. Each type of defense has strengths and weaknesses (missiles are fast but limited in range, planes are slower but have unlimited range). Satellites are a better all-around defense but are only available every so often. Some weapons aren't available in certain areas, and some enemies are resistant to certain weapons, so you must alter your strategy accordingly.","franchise":864,"franchises":[864],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[9760,8773,55029,2015,12982,22399,25311,6985,21642,36594],"tags":[18,39,268435467,268435471,536872198,1073741827],"developers":[2426],"publishers":[2426],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1286],"themes":[18,39],"genres":[11,15],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[68,65,15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":68,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984-Dec-31","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bmgvjw3rowfasatwuo3d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bmgvjw3rowfasatwuo3d","width":1000,"height":1197}},{"id":23936,"name":"Randamn","slug":"randamn","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/randamn","created_at":1473812577553,"updated_at":1517270686162,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76229,68287,29525,68142,10209,36950,77220,76217,64204],"tags":[17,18,19,268435461,268435489,1073741826],"publishers":[10909],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[17,18,19],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[75],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xsyhn3qfshm2f9a9llpt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xsyhn3qfshm2f9a9llpt","width":1000,"height":1488}},{"id":23937,"name":"Pogo Joe","slug":"pogo-joe","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pogo-joe","created_at":1473814844409,"updated_at":1517270838392,"summary":"Pogo Joe is a computer game for the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit family, written by William F.

The Embers were the embodiment of magical flame, light, and life, but as word spread about the sheer power of the Embers, they came to be hunted and captured…and so the War for Ember began...","rating":60.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":66.25,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":63.125,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":1,"games":[7202,18822,472,3025,1942,1879,1593,27421,1887,6],"tags":[1,17,22,268435460,268435465,268435468,268435471,268435487,268435488,536871019,536871029,536871063,536871086,536871139,536871208,536871421,536871504,536871670,536871682,536871814,536871838,536871938,536871939,536872070,536872232,536872628,536872647,536872668,536872847,536872928,536872978,536873089,536873364,536873400,536873486,536873580,536873787,536873863,536873889,536874398,536874542,536874916,536875046,536875078,536875096,536875130,536875147,536875159,536875196,536875197,536875232,536875233,536875241,536875253,536875265,536875271,536875275,536875304,536875308,536875311,536875316,536875319,536875324,536875331,536875337,536875340,536875344,536875356,536875361,536875400,536875455,536875485,536875598,536875640,536875671,536875677,536875712,536875764,536875792,536875793,536875891,536875934,536876027,536876033,536876201,536876217,536876228,536876273,536876286,536876339,536876373,536876490,536876571,536876678,536876706,536876730,536876969,536877242,536877612,536877616,536877815,536877882,536877965,536878059,536878371,536879227,536880060,536880168,536880568,536881456,536882365,536882399,536885458,536887720,1073741827],"developers":[1362],"publishers":[445],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[107,117,151,174,227,296,509,592,758,770,902,926,1026,1027,1158,1320,1716,1735,1756,1935,2016,2066,2177,2452,2488,2574,2668,2875,2951,2977,3486,3630,4004,4134,4166,4184,4218,4235,4247,4284,4285,4320,4321,4329,4341,4353,4359,4363,4392,4396,4399,4404,4407,4412,4419,4425,4428,4432,4444,4449,4488,4543,4573,4686,4728,4759,4765,4800,4852,4880,4881,4979,5022,5115,5121,5289,5305,5316,5361,5374,5427,5461,5578,5659,5766,5794,5818,6057,6330,6700,6704,6903,6970,7053,7147,7459,8315,9148,9256,9656,10544,11453,11487,14546,16808],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[4,9,12,15,31,32],"first_release_date":1473379200000,"platforms":[6,39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1473811200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-14","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1473379200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-09","y":2016,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Little Legends: The Battle for Willow Lane","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ww3zrxuwhuu13xsrg0pi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ww3zrxuwhuu13xsrg0pi","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wf7zcgensqp6g5w0yhkn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wf7zcgensqp6g5w0yhkn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k5hbkmkmbtepjpvyjtud.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k5hbkmkmbtepjpvyjtud","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jesvr9qywcvsmgkfsuvr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jesvr9qywcvsmgkfsuvr","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j7hkqtfbz778tsdndhhk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j7hkqtfbz778tsdndhhk","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"tSKlC6eG9mQ"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ammodqozkssslpnmwswh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ammodqozkssslpnmwswh","width":1024,"height":417},"websites":[{"category":10,"url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ember/id906826053?mt=8\u0026uo=4"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/339580"},{"category":1,"url":"http://ember.game/"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/TheGameEmber"}],"external":{"steam":"339580"}},{"id":23942,"name":"The Last Time","slug":"the-last-time","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-time","created_at":1473831452189,"updated_at":1523009391924,"summary":"The Last Time is an adventure game which combines retro graphics and game mechanics with modern nonlinear storytelling.

The object in the game is for the player to learn the basics of flying a starship so that the player can eventually become a captain of one's very own ship. It includes a simulation battle mode in which the player can pilot and fight ships of his or her choosing. It's also the first time in a video game that free-motion CGI filming took place. The in-game movies, directed by Martin Denning, at the time represented a breakthrough in CGI-Live Action rendering.","storyline":"The player takes the role of human Cadet David Forester, leader of a cadet group at Starfleet's San Francisco–based Command College. The player has to pass all the simulated missions, optionally including the infamous Kobayashi Maru scenario. The scenarios, in addition to simple combat situations, include a recreation of Kirk's near-disastrous starship confrontation with Khan Noonien Singh which Kirk ruefully admits is used to teach cadets to avoid his serious mistake that nearly doomed his ship. In addition, between simulator scenarios, Forester must keep his crew in check and prevent personality clashes from lowering team performance by choosing the right dialogue options during cutscenes.\nThe cadet crew consists of a Vulcan science officer called Sturek, a female Andorian communications officer named Vanda M'Giia, and a detached and shy human engineer Robin Brady, with Trill Jana Akton at the helm and human Geoff Corin at navigation.\nDuring the course of the game it is possible to foil the machinations of the Vanguard — a fanatical terrorist group dedicated to overthrowing the Federation government and installing Kirk as a despot — and to investigate the cause of increasing tensions around the Klingon Neutral Zone. On the other hand, it is possible to be dismissed from the Academy in disgrace if the wrong choice is made during certain full motion video sequences.","collection":3440,"franchise":18,"franchises":[18],"rating":70.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":70.0,"total_rating_count":2,"rating_count":2,"games":[54996,25311,34823,17130,13200,19301,17111,26145,8773,16687],"tags":[1,18,268435469,268435471,268435487,536871859,536871882,536872060,536872070,536874743,536875054,536875265,536875453,536875531,536875688,536876079,536877501,536879752,536881339,536882419,536882420,536882894,536883942,536884033],"developers":[1882],"publishers":[1882],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[947,970,1148,1158,3831,4142,4353,4541,4619,4776,5167,6589,8840,10427,11507,11508,11982,13030,13121],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[13,15,31],"first_release_date":873072000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":6,"date":873072000000,"human":"1997-Sep","y":1997,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t6c7c2wz1yarr9fgfisw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t6c7c2wz1yarr9fgfisw","width":640,"height":363},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/itbwtrpuwsevxtlhkcyd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"itbwtrpuwsevxtlhkcyd","width":1440,"height":810},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iu8fplm1r8ftu8gudi8k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iu8fplm1r8ftu8gudi8k","width":960,"height":542},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/odl1g1jrgm5obeaeebqa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"odl1g1jrgm5obeaeebqa","width":639,"height":356},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qokfswl6u6senz1he4lj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qokfswl6u6senz1he4lj","width":772,"height":603}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"AnhcnBy-2FE"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"eFdmToaAYjw"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"lkU9hTNTD-Y"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hkajcvm4jbbtkh1shljf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hkajcvm4jbbtkh1shljf","width":1024,"height":1302},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/364810"}],"external":{"steam":"364810"}},{"id":23947,"name":"Delta Squadron","slug":"delta-squadron","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/delta-squadron","created_at":1473906567333,"updated_at":1517270511466,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76731,54725,25311,18811,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,52119],"tags":[18,268435471,268435480,1073741827,1073741826],"publishers":[10915],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[18],"genres":[15,24],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[75],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}]},{"id":23948,"name":"Nightraiders","slug":"nightraiders","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/nightraiders","created_at":1473907200831,"updated_at":1517270816558,"summary":"A vertical scrolling shoot'em up written by Peter Filiberti and published by Datamost for the Atari 8-bit home computers.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,10209,36950,28029,10213,64204,27314,10210,71455,10212],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871882,1073741826],"developers":[10916],"publishers":[6403],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[166,970],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983-Dec-31","y":1983,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Night Raiders","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fjyqo922tn653jdoignb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fjyqo922tn653jdoignb","width":1000,"height":1529}},{"id":23949,"name":"Cohen's Tower","slug":"cohens-tower","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cohens-tower","created_at":1473907591922,"updated_at":1517270839017,"summary":"A platformer written by Frank Cohen and published by Datamost.

Players move a space ship left and right to fire at a group of alien ships near the top of the screen. They fire bullets and come swooping down like a kamikaze. Based on the colour they have different behaviour and some of them require multiple hits. To finish the stage all aliens have to be defeated. The wave is repeated in every stage, but enemies gradually become faster. Just like in the regular Galaga, the largest enemies can move down and fire a fixed beam that makes the area smaller to move. After a number of stages a Challenge Stage can be accessed with a new pattern. The player receives a bonus there based on the number of kills. You start with three lives.

You can shoot the cars if you like, but this will bring the Secret Police and their bullets. You should make your way to one of the embassies, where you can learn the combination needed to open the treasury vault. This is also where you can find most of the secretive items. After picking the combination locks of four embassies, you will have both secret numbers needed to open the treasury safe, which contains the gold. \n \nThe most profitable way to crack a safe is to pick its combination numbers by finding the right number sequences. This involves cycling through various numbers (0 through 99) on your keypad. Pick numbers until there are no more to find.

A mystical dragon sets out to find crystals of fire, air, and water, in order to gain special powers, and eggs which will hatch into new dragons. The dragon must defeat enemies by shooting fireballs, which is accomplished by pushing the joystick upwards and in the direction the player wishes to shoot in. Some enemies can be killed with one shot, others with two, and some take more and more fireballs to be killed as the game progresses. What is truly unique about this game is that the fire and water crystals must never be dropped off consecutively, or else they will destroy one another. An air crystal must separate the two. Also, players must learn to conserve fireballs, otherwise they will find they have no way of defending themselves against their enemies.

If you jump onto a trampoline where the other character is, they will be stunned briefly, giving you an opportunity to make them lose a life. What is truly unique is how the computer player also has a limited number of lives just like the human player does. After one player loses all of their lives, the other player is awarded extra points for his or her remaining lives. If you want to get big points, you have to adopt a different strategy to avoid having your opponent lose all their lives. Truly a unique and fun experience, although the game can be frustrating to play against the computer as you'll find it easy to stay alive longer than the computer.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36794,36608,34919,51485,22819,40524,51683,24199,23175,16468],"tags":[1,268435489,1073741826],"developers":[2522],"publishers":[2522],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpv2ffrvpi9tpj94mfsi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hpv2ffrvpi9tpj94mfsi","width":1000,"height":1386}},{"id":24016,"name":"Laser Gates","slug":"laser-gates","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/laser-gates","created_at":1474249523521,"updated_at":1517271040622,"summary":"The thousand galaxies quake at the news: the Cryptic Computer, the galactic defense synthesizer which has maintained peace for the five centuries since the Wars on Zevon, has malfunctioned!

Through the mech, the player purchases surface combat units, airlifts them across the battlefield, and issues them orders. These command activities can only be performed through the mech. Vehicles follow their assigned orders (which are fairly basic: patrol, garrison, capture base) until they either run out of fuel or are destroyed.

Missions can have varied objectives, but any enemy crafts shot down will reward money used to buy, modify, and repair aircraft. While Ken Thomas is the main character of the game, other pilots can be used in missions as the game progresses, and using them can open up bonus missions as well as alter the story. The player can only play as Delta Squadron pilots, but the story is told from the perspective of both E.D.A.F.'s Delta Squadron and their O.C.C. Ace counterparts. Medals are awarded to each pilot as they reach milestones, such as number of enemy aces shot down or number of aircraft purchased.","collection":2717,"franchise":1155,"franchises":[1155],"popularity":2.0,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":60.0,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[28010,12632,70861,27209,36608,34919,19658,57372,55752,16468],"tags":[1,536870990,536875271,536876964,536884027],"category":0,"keywords":[78,4359,6052,13115],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1078272000000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1078272000000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Mar-03","y":2004,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"AirForce Delta: Blue Wing Knights\nDeadly Skies III","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Airforce Delta: Blue Wing Knights","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Deadly Skies III","comment":"European Title"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t5qr5pkot4pngjuck2f8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t5qr5pkot4pngjuck2f8","width":1527,"height":2156}},{"id":24188,"name":"Alien Blast: The Encounter","slug":"alien-blast-the-encounter","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-blast-the-encounter","created_at":1474567334896,"updated_at":1513072028647,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":25.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":25.0,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[36608,34919,40524,23175,16468,1070,2940,68324,28029,37022],"tags":[1,536870915],"category":0,"keywords":[3],"themes":[1],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fqqncmkdjgdblniyfx6k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fqqncmkdjgdblniyfx6k","width":640,"height":908}},{"id":24189,"name":"Company of Heroes: Limited Edition","slug":"company-of-heroes-limited-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/company-of-heroes-limited-edition","created_at":1474567366840,"updated_at":1517264327990,"summary":"Company of Heroes: Limited Edition includes: \n \nWorld War 2 Survival Guide Camouflage and Cover \nExclusive Steelbook-packaging \nEight unit-cards with facts about the shown unit on the back. \n \nThis version was only released in Europe.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":89.5,"aggregated_rating_count":0,"total_rating":89.5,"total_rating_count":0,"version_parent":654,"version_title":"Limited Edition","games":[44591,68377,28358,27312,47319,65609,41621,101212,100947,99412],"tags":[536872006],"category":0,"first_release_date":1180656000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1180656000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Jun-01","y":2007,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/frqydkjhjybwsqm7dx0k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"frqydkjhjybwsqm7dx0k","width":800,"height":1144}},{"id":24190,"name":"Champions of Norrath","slug":"champions-of-norrath","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/champions-of-norrath","created_at":1474567386613,"updated_at":1516180596007,"summary":"Champions of Norrath is a third-person dungeon crawler based on the EverQuest universe.

The game player works with NYPD detectives Lennie Briscoe and Ed Green as they investigate the crime and make the arrest. Once accomplished, the player works with ADA Serena Southerlyn to try to crack the case, but there are twists and turns that reveal dark secrets about the sport and its players. For the first time in the game series, and in the format of the show, a second junior detective's role for the player is introduced, rather than the player being Briscoe's partner. This was due to the developers' wish to include Jesse L. Martin in one of their games. DA Charles Northcutt, played by Alan Oppenheimer, is a character created exclusively for the game who does not appear in the main show.","collection":2148,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":68.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":68.0,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[22425,26145,41895,19290,29730,44242,43130,13189,18623,28277],"tags":[268435469,268435487,536871157,536871939,536872060,536875054,536875257,536875291,536876383,536879036,536883282,536883283],"developers":[754],"publishers":[7486,12843,11247,754],"category":0,"keywords":[245,1027,1148,4142,4345,4379,5471,8124,12370,12371],"genres":[13,31],"first_release_date":1096934400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1096934400000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Oct-05","y":2004,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nehopbv8ze0hsgotdfco.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nehopbv8ze0hsgotdfco","width":300,"height":225},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/b3z6ek5zgpcn5htryjyh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b3z6ek5zgpcn5htryjyh","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rwayygjhx2jvnwvlexnz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rwayygjhx2jvnwvlexnz","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpxbcbxvorsebjeflkna.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hpxbcbxvorsebjeflkna","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v2drdufkartsctdn1pz6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v2drdufkartsctdn1pz6","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vd7ghmfifzrzadrh8agh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vd7ghmfifzrzadrh8agh","width":980,"height":735},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nhox9g28hgdcojkgt5oh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nhox9g28hgdcojkgt5oh","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i2hwqpzvenryvzadtq5q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i2hwqpzvenryvzadtq5q","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vckvdgnwxdkng7doazku.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vckvdgnwxdkng7doazku","width":800,"height":500}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"18EsOoz4RhI"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ysrer3c2hkt2kyst5vpc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ysrer3c2hkt2kyst5vpc","width":1536,"height":1152},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_Justice_Is_Served"}]},{"id":24252,"name":"Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex","slug":"ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex","created_at":1474570847963,"updated_at":1526940246981,"summary":"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is an action game based on the television series of the same name.

Gameplay is from a 3rd person perspective; you will need to fight, jump and climb your way through twelve missions, with the story unfolding in full motion video between missions and communications received during a mission. There are many different weapons available for use, and after defeating enemies you may be able to pick up extra ammo or weapons; occasionally you will also acquire a hacking key. With this, you will be able to see the location of other enemies in the area onscreen. You will also be able to attempt to hack certain enemies; when attempting to hack, two spinning rings appear on the screen. If you successfully match up the ring patterns, you will be able to control the enemies actions. Computer terminals can also be found in many areas allowing you to hack into enemies. The game can be played on three difficulty levels, and a multiplayer mode is available where up to four players can compete.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":65.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":65.6666666666667,"total_rating_count":3,"games":[76246,19341,28029,32902,24920,272,68287,10039,68142,36608],"tags":[1,268435461],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1102464000000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1102464000000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Dec-08","y":2004,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ihy8cbxlqninxkcmadqy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ihy8cbxlqninxkcmadqy","width":585,"height":300}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wnkeezxxafteyjmn0imo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wnkeezxxafteyjmn0imo","width":1519,"height":2160}},{"id":24253,"name":"Galactic

Players engage in hand-to-hand combat in 3D arenas and use axes, swords, boomerangs, and magic spells (e.g., energy balls, summoned creatures) to drain opponents' life meters. Battles are highlighted by cries of pain, colorful explosions, and slow-motion sequences that zoom in on defeated characters. A handful of female characters wear revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; some of these characters' breasts also jiggle during combat. Some in-game text in also contains suggestive material (e.g., \"Here's a better idea: 'Zoom camera into Tifa's cleavage!'\"). Various portrait galleries depict partially nude female characters; the general shapes of their bodies are displayed instead of actual detail (i.e., no nipples or genitalia).

Tables could be saved on floppy disks and freely traded; Pinball Construction Set was not needed to play the tables.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[36608,34919,16468,23175,40524,68324,1070,28029,59516,55289],"tags":[1,268435486,536873706,1073741826],"publishers":[10329,1],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[2794],"themes":[1],"genres":[30],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[14,13,65,75,149,125,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":149,"date":504835200000,"region":5,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":125,"date":491702400000,"region":5,"human":"1985-Aug-01","y":1985,"m":8},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xcekd5iwbhyzx9t7woyc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xcekd5iwbhyzx9t7woyc","width":1000,"height":978}},{"id":24378,"name":"Ascension: Return of the Fallen","slug":"ascension-return-of-the-fallen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ascension-return-of-the-fallen","created_at":1474582781928,"updated_at":1474582808264,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"game":8638,"category":2},{"id":24379,"name":"Jack Attack","slug":"jack-attack","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/jack-attack","created_at":1474584022589,"updated_at":1517270825263,"summary":"Jack Attack is a puzzle game released on the Commodore 64 and 16.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[55752,10039,25222,25646,37094,1070,60044,19289,51485,26223],"tags":[1,268435464,268435465,536872307,536873787,536875073,536875875,536876952,536877225,1073741828],"publishers":[10999],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1395,2875,4161,4963,6040,6313],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,9],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[93,15,94],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":94,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":93,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lgsnwhmenx87djuzj8k4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lgsnwhmenx87djuzj8k4","width":1000,"height":1370}},{"id":24380,"name":"Bugaboo","slug":"bugaboo","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bugaboo","created_at":1474585007871,"updated_at":1517270842534,"summary":"Help Bugaboo (The Flea) escape a cavern while avoiding a large dragon.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,10039,1188,55752,63138,36608,74863,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464,536872961,1073741828],"developers":[11000],"publishers":[11000,9519],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2049],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[15,26,25,27],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":1,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":441676800000,"region":1,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":441676800000,"region":1,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Roland in the Caves","comment":"Other"},{"name":"The Flea"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ug11kmbxk7zcn4bjmfei.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ug11kmbxk7zcn4bjmfei","width":800,"height":1257}},{"id":24381,"name":"Silicon Warrior","slug":"silicon-warrior","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/silicon-warrior","created_at":1474585763437,"updated_at":1517270842565,"summary":"Make a time journey into the year 2084. \n \nThe SYBORGS, a superhuman race of Technocrates, developed a computer of the 10th generation.

It still keeps the complex story, character level-up and customization though. The game features main characters from the other Final Fantasy titles, two from each title (the protagonist and the antagonist). The plot revolves around the battle of the two gods, Cosmos and Chaos. The protagonists will form teams in order to fight through Chaos' armies and find their crystals which will later be used to destroy Chaos. Each character has his own campaign to go through at the end of which a crystal will be collected. \n \nThe game also features a single fight and an arcade mode where the player will be able to choose his fighter and the opponent (opponents are automatically chosen by the game if playing in arcade mode though). All of the character's experience and skills received through the campaign are saved for the other game modes (and vice-versa, for example: if Cloud had a level equal to 12 when completing the campaign, he will also appear to have the same level when viewing him in the character roster in Arcade or Quick Battle mode). \n \nAnother feature is that the items you find during the campaign belong to you, the player. That means you can move items from a character to another. The game also features extra content such as villains, costumes etc. which can be unlocked by using PP. You get such points from each fight and completed campaign.","collection":2440,"franchise":4,"franchises":[4],"hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36534,12632,55092,47823,11214,36926,25921,18398,26766,13623],"tags":[1,17,268435460,268435468,268435487,536871208,536871433,536871938,536872594,536873311,536875046,536877984,536878440,536879793,1073741829,1073741826],"developers":[858,26,769],"publishers":[26],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,5],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[296,521,1026,1682,2399,4134,7072,7528,8881],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[4,12,31],"first_release_date":1485907200000,"pulse_count":15,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1517356800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jan-31","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1517356800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jan-31","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1485907200000,"region":5,"human":"2017-Feb-01","y":2017,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1485907200000,"region":5,"human":"2017-Feb-01","y":2017,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"ディシディア ファイナルファンタジー オペラ オムニア","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Dissidia Final Fantasy: Opera Omnia"},{"name":"DFFOO","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cokr74ujq68lq30jpnmp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cokr74ujq68lq30jpnmp","width":1063,"height":679},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mnzu84dqpe6cznmyw8fq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mnzu84dqpe6cznmyw8fq","width":1063,"height":637},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tgy4aesltd1q9rnckfzd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tgy4aesltd1q9rnckfzd","width":1063,"height":637},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vzfhhhrj08ih47ysbhq6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vzfhhhrj08ih47ysbhq6","width":1063,"height":637},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dyfgbu5rynmvvjjshnr8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dyfgbu5rynmvvjjshnr8","width":1063,"height":637}],"artworks":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iadufz9fvzmvkkhits6m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iadufz9fvzmvkkhits6m","width":1200,"height":730}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"85GI-rnBESU"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"NYzPnCiJDuE"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ye7paxfeak18q2idno22.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ye7paxfeak18q2idno22","width":960,"height":884},"websites":[{"category":10,"url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dissidia-final-fantasy-oo/id1282951846?l=ja\u0026ls=1\u0026mt=8"},{"category":14,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DFFOperaOmnia"},{"category":12,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.DFFOperaOmnian"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/dissidiaffoo"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.jp.square-enix.com/DFFOO/"},{"category":2,"url":"http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Dissidia_Final_Fantasy_Opera_Omnia"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/DFF_OperaOmnia"}]},{"id":24401,"name":"Stak Bots - Breakout","slug":"stak-bots-breakout","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/stak-bots-breakout","created_at":1474652573140,"updated_at":1474657272004,"summary":"Destroy the enemy!

It's notable that there aren't new weapons to be picked during the main game; instead those are obtained only as unlockables after the game's completion.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[23175,59516,55289,37022,25646,28010,55803,25311,55752,12579],"tags":[1,268435487,536870990,536872098],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,1186],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":912643200000,"platforms":[45,7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":912643200000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Dec-03","y":1998,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":922838400000,"region":2,"human":"1999-Mar-31","y":1999,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":927158400000,"region":1,"human":"1999-May-20","y":1999,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1175126400000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Mar-29","y":2007,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"T.R.A.G.: Tactical Rescue Assault Group - Mission of Mercy","comment":"North American Name"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/skygxkbw20i9qyws2hiu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"skygxkbw20i9qyws2hiu","width":639,"height":479},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ot78px8f0hcepzu2xdby.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ot78px8f0hcepzu2xdby","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j2t8qwph8wrjsvc1gl6o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j2t8qwph8wrjsvc1gl6o","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/thkjrxis4rpauzm4c46z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"thkjrxis4rpauzm4c46z","width":800,"height":600}],"videos":[{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"rBxicxhrat8"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ge2dijt5aslszqpehnzr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ge2dijt5aslszqpehnzr","width":481,"height":480}},{"id":24431,"name":"Sewer Sam","slug":"sewer-sam","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sewer-sam","created_at":1474926130139,"updated_at":1517271049730,"summary":"It's a lovely day and Sam is waiting in Central Park to meet his girlfriend Sally.

Subterranea's gameplay is broken into two types of screens. The first is a side view dogfight between your ship and some hapless enemies that are trying to home in on it. Things heat up in the second (and far more common) type of screen, which consists of Defender-style action minus the humanoids. You're required to shoot a specific number of aliens, then pass through a gate to the next stage. \n \nLike Defender, aliens come in all shapes and sizes, and have varying attack patterns. Some of them shoot at you, some bounce, but all the action is a far cry faster than Defender. Once all the aliens are destroyed, you must pass through an electro gate that zaps in certain patterns--failing this forces you to repeat the current level without scoring any points. After at least three Defender style screens, it's back to the dogfight. Subterranea awards extra lives not by scoring, but by completing stages without being hit. while Subterranea borrows concepts from other games and doesn't appear to be very original, there's just something about it that keeps you coming back for yet another game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,36950,64204,76246,27314,10039,19341,25311,76722],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536875485,536875822,1073741828],"developers":[2522],"publishers":[2522],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[4573,4910],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yv6kcdqmiuowwiuyc9pg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yv6kcdqmiuowwiuyc9pg","width":1000,"height":1318}},{"id":24436,"name":"Computer Repair Simulator","slug":"computer-repair-simulator","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/computer-repair-simulator","created_at":1474940522067,"updated_at":1518025924481,"summary":"Computer Repair simulator is a revolutionary educational game that can me used as a interactive guide , an aid for teachers or just a fun toy for computer nerds!

Someone will make them small, of several clicks, and will be sending new tasks to the robot all the time. Another player will spend some time before the game.

As players traverse around a city, they can identify and interact with ghost-like creatures (Yo-Kai) and use them in turn-based combat against other creatures. Yo-Kai can use various attacks (e.g., punches, sword slashes, magic spells) to drain opponents' life meters; colorful light effects, smacking/zapping sounds, and depleting hit points indicate damage during battles. A handful of sequences also depict violent acts: a cat hit by a truck; a child beaten up by bullies. The game includes several depictions and references to bodily functions: a Yo-Kai called Snotsolong with mucous dripping from its nose; Yo-Kai (Cuttincheez and Cheeksqueek) with buttocks for heads that use flatulence-like attacks; dialogue that states, “It smells a little like my farts. . .” and “I mean, if it were my farts that had made this smoke. . .

Only the songs sung of one’s deeds will carry an Ombrian’s legacy beyond death. Those who hold even the smallest morsel of power will make every effort to ensure their songs live on. Enter the Mascherines - masks from an ancient time that allow its wielders to channel the elements into destructive magic. \n \nThe Mascherines have perpetuated a culture of inequality between the power-hungry guildsmen known as the Masquerada and the impoverished lower classes, the Contadani. A prolonged civil war, ignited by Contadani rebels who steal Mascherines from the Masquerada, has only drawn scars of mistrust across the Citte since. \n \nPlayers follow the trails of an expert investigator, Cicero Gavar, who was exiled for a crime against the state five years ago. Cicero has now been summoned back to Ombre to solve the mysterious kidnapping of the diplomat Razitof Azrus, whose wake has left a trail of death. As other members of the Masquerada join Cicero's' investigation, all having their doubts about one another within this culture of deception, their faith will be pushed to the limit as a deeper conspiracy lurks in the shadows of Ombre. \n \nCicero and his four companions each have their own classes, of which there are three distinct types: the roguish Sicario, the monolithic Pavisierre, and the bardic Dirge. Each of Cicero’s companions specializes in one of these stances in combination with a specific element, while Cicero himself is able to choose his own element and swap between the stances at will. \n \nPlayers can take advantage of synergies between each character’s magic spells by way of the Elemental Tag system. By casting particular elements in succession, players can leverage element-based status effects for crowd control, such as blinding smog or a debilitating cloud of steam. For example, an earth spell inflicts an enemy with an earth elemental tag, which can be triggered by a water spell to ensnare the enemy in show-stopping mud. \n \nSkill modifiers allow for more variations of battlefield tactics. For example, with Zephyr – Cicero’s teleportation spell – players can choose an offense-oriented modification that blasts out hot air when Cicero re-appears. Alternatively, a defensive modification could blast cold air to freeze enemies at Cicero’s original location, buying him time to recover or cast other spells. \n \nPositioning on the battlefield has great importance in Masquerada. All player characters, NPCs and enemies have armour (whether physical or magical) that must be dealt with before being able to hurt them. With flank attacks, armour can only mitigate half the damage dealt to a target, and attacks to the rear cause full damage to a target. As such, planning to position one’s magic attacks becomes vital.","rating":80.0,"popularity":3.0,"aggregated_rating":71.5,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":75.75,"total_rating_count":10,"rating_count":2,"games":[22387,14760,23733,18869,36926,22747,55092,3222,27771,12511],"tags":[1,17,268435468,268435480,268435488,536871029,536871208,536871307,536871338,536871938,536873493,536873940,536874595,536874921,536875046,536875066,536875136,536875165,536875680,536875783,536875794,536875795,536875830,536876291,536876969,536888782,536888783,1073741827],"developers":[11145],"publishers":[11146],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[117,296,395,426,1026,2581,3028,3683,4009,4134,4154,4224,4253,4768,4871,4882,4883,4918,5379,6057,17870,17871],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12,24,32],"first_release_date":1475193600000,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[45,6,14,48,49,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1502150400000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Aug-08","y":2017,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1502150400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Aug-08","y":2017,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1475193600000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Sep-30","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1475193600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-30","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1475193600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-30","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1502150400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Aug-08","y":2017,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1503446400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Aug-23","y":2017,"m":8},{"category":6,"platform":130,"date":1514678400000,"human":"2017-Q4","y":2017,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kvxqkhvihstogpo5sl9h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kvxqkhvihstogpo5sl9h","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hfp9gy2fkhahv6sp7mwr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hfp9gy2fkhahv6sp7mwr","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aiqbhucy3dnox1r3t2og.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aiqbhucy3dnox1r3t2og","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/w11uuhzr5qcpohdirbkp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w11uuhzr5qcpohdirbkp","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tqp50o5ofigesfarzsmv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tqp50o5ofigesfarzsmv","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"mvZS1CBLLBM"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"fpapxyXs3lU"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"5-hGxCt_7w0"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"x4aYvfiwap8"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bzx4vo5n1savwx3q3ubj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bzx4vo5n1savwx3q3ubj","width":1644,"height":1152},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The

Once all the enemies are defeated then return home. The game moves in a forward direction where the screen objects move towards and down to the player. Approaching enemy ships are small, in the distance, and become larger and move faster as they approach the player. The player controls a fighter at the bottom of the screen, which can only move from side to side. Shots can be fired at a diagonal, as well as straight, by twisting the joystick from side to side. At certain stages, ground targets will appear and can be destroyed by using the \"Burn\" button. The laser disc generated backgrounds are largely non-interactive during game play. They form the backgrounds on which the game is played on. Scenes do work in with the backgrounds, however that is the extent. Some backgrounds appear as they should have elements of interactively, however, were not used in the release of the game. These include scenes where the player is going through an asteroid field and asteroids fly towards the player. Another scene is in the crystal caverns, where there are many obstacles which could have been made to be avoided. These are only two of many scenes which could have had interactive elements. The game may have been decided to have been too hard to play with these background obstacles and computer fighters to play. Hence removing the background interactively to make the game more playable. The game starts with the player in Frald Rancer's home city, then taking off into outer space via a fly-by of the city. The backgrounds are very Sci-Fi and are fantasy themed. They are very interesting, more so than the game. The music from the laser disc also complements the laser disc video very well and makes up for the sometimes annoying, computer generated sounds.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,10209,28029,64204,27314,10213,71455,26766,10210],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871859,536871882,536872197,1073741826],"publishers":[11154],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[166,947,970,1285],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":441676800000,"region":5,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Interstellar Laser Fantasy"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l6lb62g3tmjsf6exkmmo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l6lb62g3tmjsf6exkmmo","width":1000,"height":1318}},{"id":24506,"name":"Terraguard","slug":"terraguard","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/terraguard","created_at":1475367388403,"updated_at":1517271056658,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,10209,10213,36950,76722,57627,52752,47144,26353],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,1073741826],"publishers":[10478],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[71],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":71,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sa6bxrnwz9uwhqebp4rf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sa6bxrnwz9uwhqebp4rf","width":800,"height":1088}},{"id":24507,"name":"Encounter","slug":"encounter","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/encounter","created_at":1475369087471,"updated_at":1515677108663,"summary":"Encounter is a vertical-scrolling space shooter developed by Cory Bruening and released for DOS.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[68287,36950,28029,27314,64204,142,26766,25300,71455,11253],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871859,536871882,536871937,536875151,536875258,536875666,536875879,536876005,536876123,536877141,1073741825],"developers":[7162],"publishers":[7162,9466],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[947,970,1025,4239,4346,4754,4967,5093,5211,6229],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[63,65,16,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":694137600000,"region":1,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":694137600000,"region":1,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kxx9lvrvom4gn7vromao.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kxx9lvrvom4gn7vromao","width":1000,"height":1291}},{"id":24508,"name":"Genesis","slug":"genesis","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/genesis","created_at":1475371270316,"updated_at":1517270687223,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,10209,10213,36950,76722,57627,52752,47144,26353],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,1073741826],"developers":[1076],"publishers":[1076],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[13,65,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pzpee84kkatwjcwy9tcp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pzpee84kkatwjcwy9tcp","width":1000,"height":1501}},{"id":24509,"name":"Zenji","slug":"zenji","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/zenji","created_at":1475377023068,"updated_at":1517271056710,"summary":"Let us call the \"Many\" the \"Elements.\" Then let us see that in the vast blackness, beyond the beyond, the Elements assemble around the Source.

and spellcasting. Each turn you develop your tower by placing blocks, constructing rooms, and play various spells. Your tower can have Libraries (store spells), Crystals (generate mana), Dwarf Dwellings (give you dwarves to repair the tower) and some other rooms. The crucial room is Archmage's Chamber. It's position is hidden from enemy and you must protect it at all costs, or you will lose. Room scheme is very important: the higher you place it, the more powerful it gets. Higher tower gets tremendous advantage over the lower one. But beware of Lightning strike! It can start a fire that will destroy the whole tower in several turns, so keep Dwarf Firefighters ready. Some rooms work much better underground, but there is a risk of flood! The overall goal of the game match is to destroy the enemy's Archmage's Chambers by crushing, burning or flooding it. It's not that simple however, because enemy will do his best to destroy your Archmage at the same time!","rating":60.0,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":60.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":60.0,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":0,"games":[33603,36962,55888,65827,32283,75065,75813,55308,25640,75306],"tags":[268435471,268435488],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2],"genres":[15,32],"first_release_date":1419292800000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1419292800000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Dec-23","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1419292800000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Dec-23","y":2014,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g4ejxsduwyh0grc1ozrr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g4ejxsduwyh0grc1ozrr","width":1728,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uxhkz54hihtwqqcfygpg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uxhkz54hihtwqqcfygpg","width":1728,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xqh3ap69u7vq2ygpesbs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xqh3ap69u7vq2ygpesbs","width":1728,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/crbg4yvcmm4uukfbmtv6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"crbg4yvcmm4uukfbmtv6","width":1860,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kbdxnkttt4zwl6msuk0u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kbdxnkttt4zwl6msuk0u","width":660,"height":330}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"sJkN29YwbA0"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pvzw5mahibgqf2jr75kr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pvzw5mahibgqf2jr75kr","width":460,"height":215},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.palmkingdoms.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/335100"}],"external":{"steam":"335100"}},{"id":24564,"name":"Ninja Battle Heroes","slug":"ninja-battle-heroes","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ninja-battle-heroes","created_at":1475433440084,"updated_at":1518075782512,"summary":"Fight through enemies with katanas and throwing stars, absorb Spirit and summon powerful legendary heroes!","rating":66.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":73.0,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":0,"publishers":[1722],"category":0,"first_release_date":1412812800000,"platforms":[37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1437609600000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Jul-23","y":2015,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1412812800000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Oct-09","y":2014,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oz1spkiqt2e51qykkjmq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oz1spkiqt2e51qykkjmq","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aozhbvcdh5egdblbxxzh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aozhbvcdh5egdblbxxzh","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s9kjhsldtrlqamgdhrrh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s9kjhsldtrlqamgdhrrh","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/i5j6oo92cuyt9nak6gme.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i5j6oo92cuyt9nak6gme","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rqgcqqs62xao37hl2m2n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rqgcqqs62xao37hl2m2n","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j5rvth6se9zpsblx4dib.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j5rvth6se9zpsblx4dib","width":660,"height":330}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/udupaviz5vnfus3rqvim.jpg","cloudinary_id":"udupaviz5vnfus3rqvim","width":400,"height":168},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.tomcreate-games.com/ninjabattleheroes/"}]},{"id":24565,"name":"Pongu","slug":"pongu","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/pongu","created_at":1475433507188,"updated_at":1475433668558,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70.0,"total_rating_count":1,"category":0,"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/holz7cwqyfubyq19sl3u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"holz7cwqyfubyq19sl3u","width":600,"height":338}]},{"id":24566,"name":"Hyphen","slug":"hyphen","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hyphen","created_at":1475433529218,"updated_at":1523426135292,"summary":"Spin your way to victory in this devilishly hard, ultra-cool action/puzzle game for PC.

Ouendan stars a cheer squad rhythmically cheering for various troubled people, presented in game in the style of a manga comic. In each stage, players use the DS touchscreen to tap specifically marked spots that appear in rhythm to various Japanese pop songs, scoring points for accurate timing and avoiding a poor performance which can cause the stage to end prematurely. Though never released in Western markets, it was a popular import to these regions, leading to the development of the Westernized spiritual sequel Elite Beat Agents, as well as a direct Japanese sequel Moero!

Players compete in a series of matches of various types, with the general aim of out-killing opponents. The PC version supports multiplayer online or over a local area network.

Development took 18 months, and the game was initially intended to be an expansion for Unreal. Unreal Tournament received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the graphics, artificial intelligence and gameplay, although the console ports were noted for having limitations. The game won several awards, and remakes have been attempted by fans.

The five playable factions are: Iron Guard, a team of human mercenaries led by former Tournament champion Malcolm; the Ronin, a band of four survivors of a Skaarj attack on a human colony; Liandri, a series of advanced humanoid robots custom-built or retrofitted for combat; the Krall, a warlike race of aliens formerly under the leadership of the Skaarj, returning from their initial appearance in the original Unreal; and the Necris, warriors who have undergone the process of the same name, making them stronger at the expense of replacing their biological processes with \"Nanoblack\", effectively turning them into undead soldiers (hence the name, Necris). In the Campaign, players control members of the Ronin, and the Necris serve as the chief antagonists.\n\nIn the game's story, set in 2307, some years after the events of UT2004, a Necris attack occurs on a colony on unknown planet, releasing armed Kralls on the humans. The colony is defenseless, but a group of Ronins arrives on the scene, defending the survivors. Reaper, the group's leader, advises his second-in-command warrior Othello and his sister Jester to destroy the orbital Necris blockade with a fighter, and orders team's sniper expert, Bishop, to provide cover as he swarms to save the colony. Suddenly, he is caught in the explosion of an incoming rocket missile and passes out, but not before seeing an unknown Necris woman shooting a soldier next to him. Reaper is rescued by Othello and Jester and wakes up in the base of the Izanagi, a guerrilla force that fights against Necris and Axon, and he meets with the leader, revealed to be Malcolm, who also leads the Iron Guard as the Izanagi's army. He explains that the Necris attack was masterminded by Liandri, who also turn some of the Krall, into Necris, controlled undead soldiers. The unknown woman who Reaper saw turns out to be Akasha, the Necris operative who destroyed the colony and also leads the Necris forces.

As players move through abandoned buildings and deserted facilities, they shoot at several soldiers, aliens, and mutant dogs. Realistic guns and rifles are used to kill enemies from long range (periscope views on mutant dogs) and up-close (shots to soldiers' heads). Blood splatters from injured enemies and may pool on the ground; in one scene, a man writhing in pain on the floor can be shot dead. During the course of the game, players' character is able to drink alcohol and feel its effects: vision becomes blurry and foggy; the agent has trouble walking straight.

Set in 2060, in a world on the cusp of the second technological revolution, entangled in a mass of information, energy, transportation, and surveillance networks, it follows the career of three distinct mercenaries employed to fight corporate wars. Whether it's the stoic Ivan, gung-ho Alex Carter, or the determined Jason Wood, you will be facing a vast army of autonomous mecha, tanks, gunships, submarines, and other thralls of enemy corporations in a war for power and money.\n\nYou won't fight your wars with just fists. Your armor and rifle are just the start. You will also have access to multiple combat vehicles, including the nimble CW-54 Hunter, stealthy RG-2 Spectre, and indomitable HAW-5 Peacemaker, backed up by an array of superweapons and autonomous support drones.

Your town is invaded by Targ riders, you must manouvre the heroic vehicle Whummel to destroy them. From time to time, a Spectar comes into screen, and can be destroyed for extra bonus. \n \nAction takes place into a 9x9 grid, \"Crystal City\", where the player's vehicle must avoid and chase down 10 enemy wedge-shaped vehicles. When all enemies are destroyed, you are awarded an extra bonus and can access the following level. Two players can alternate in the game. You use a 4 way joystick to control the Whummel, and a pushbutton to fire at enemies. Progressing in the gameplay causes the Targs to become faster and smarter, for a fast and furious gameplay. \n \nA small trivia on the game and characters name: apparently, Targ stands for Target, Spectar stands for Special Target. \n \nWhile in that period many western companies licensed games from japanese developers (Exidy itself licensed Nintendo's Sheriff as Bandido) targ is one of the few western games that made it in the opposite way, being licensed by Sega for japanese distribution. \n \nThis game has a sequel, always released in 1980, Spectar.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,11253,55752,22690,28029,10039,15851,18764,36781,20918],"tags":[1,268435461,268435470,268435486,268435489,536871223,536871846,536871937,536872078,536875046,536875412,536875416,536879173,1073741827],"developers":[2523],"publishers":[2523],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[311,934,1025,1166,4134,4500,4504,8261],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,14,30,33],"first_release_date":347068800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":347068800000,"region":2,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jgl0dy6ehmjzytlzldnz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jgl0dy6ehmjzytlzldnz","width":1000,"height":216},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":24829,"name":"Space Odyssey","slug":"space-odyssey","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/space-odyssey","created_at":1475824303752,"updated_at":1517270853016,"summary":"Space Odyssey is about exploring the sci-fi universe, enjoy the pleasable graphics along with amazing soundtracks.

comes Wasteland 3! Following the critically acclaimed releases of 2014's Wasteland 2 and 2015's Wasteland 2: Director's Cut, fans have been clamoring for a direct sequel. Now we can bring it to you, with your help! \n \nYou start the game as the sole survivor of Team November, a Ranger squad dispatched to the icy Colorado wastes. This is a land of buried secrets, lost technology, fearsome lunatics, and deadly factions. No one here has ever heard of the Desert Rangers. Your reputation is yours to build from scratch, and your choices may save this land or doom it. With a renewed focus on macro-reactivity, you’ll be picking between warring factions, deciding whether locations are destroyed or saved, and making other far reaching decisions that have a marked impact on the shape of your world. \n \n- A party-based role-playing game, with a renewed focus on our trademark complex story reactivity and strategic combat. \n- By including vehicles, environmental dangers, and a revamped, more fluid action system, we are evolving on Wasteland 2's deep tactical turn-based combat and unique encounter design. \n- Play by yourself or with a friend in story-driven synchronous or asynchronous multiplayer.

Despite this, the game sold worse than expected and led Capcom to change the direction of the series to a more action-oriented approach.

A web of red tape awaits you. Will you be able to dodge the snares of bureaucratic regulations? Can you win the covert game playing of the Imperial monopolies? Can you survive the feeding frenzy of the Empire's interstellar sharks?","collection":2466,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,25300,25311,36950,36926,54842,59516,36534,18398,55289],"tags":[18,268435468,268435487,536871859,536871938,536874526,536874527,1073741827,1073741825],"developers":[9552],"publishers":[9552],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[947,1026,3614,3615],"themes":[18],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[75],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Empire 2: Interstellar Sharks","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uvx32l5nqozfcx9a8hvm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uvx32l5nqozfcx9a8hvm","width":559,"height":382},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hgbjcqugwft5ycc6o7s0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hgbjcqugwft5ycc6o7s0","width":554,"height":380},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q1b7rbbyqbrcjejwj2ri.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q1b7rbbyqbrcjejwj2ri","width":559,"height":384},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vwfy9v5i81b2uraiwsyd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vwfy9v5i81b2uraiwsyd","width":555,"height":382},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nisqlhanoazibh1sh8of.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nisqlhanoazibh1sh8of","width":555,"height":382}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fisqpw02ktt5dyleggug.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fisqpw02ktt5dyleggug","width":553,"height":381}},{"id":24894,"name":"Empire III: Armageddon","slug":"empire-iii-armageddon","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/empire-iii-armageddon","created_at":1476178215184,"updated_at":1515646646447,"collection":2466,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,25300,25311,27922,49414,18811,12632,54842,36950,36608],"tags":[18,268435468,536871938,536872983,1073741827,1073741825],"developers":[9552],"publishers":[9552],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1026,2071],"themes":[18],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[75],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Empire 3: Armageddon","comment":"Other"}]},{"id":24895,"name":"Alien Hell","slug":"alien-hell","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/alien-hell","created_at":1476182148680,"updated_at":1517270779681,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[59516,12579,26145,486,51485,25300,24048,43130,27449,14605],"tags":[21,268435487,268435489,1073741827],"publishers":[11257],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[21],"genres":[31,33],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":378604800000,"region":2,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/obxv6n0c9ewqtewbghtw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"obxv6n0c9ewqtewbghtw","width":1000,"height":1462}},{"id":24896,"name":"Stratos","slug":"stratos","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/stratos","created_at":1476182939086,"updated_at":1517270776392,"summary":"A crosshair shoot'em up published by Adventure International for several 8-bit systems.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,10209,36950,28029,142,64204,14364,10213,27314,71455],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871882,536871937,1073741828],"publishers":[1081],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[166,970,1025],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[65,75,126],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":75,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982-Dec-31","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":65,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982-Dec-31","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":126,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/onik26c0hrqvjacpb2rm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"onik26c0hrqvjacpb2rm","width":1000,"height":1460},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":75,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":65,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":24897,"name":"Galactic Attack","slug":"galactic-attack","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/galactic-attack","created_at":1476183822276,"updated_at":1513072638911,"summary":"Galactic Attack, also known as Layer Section (レイヤーセクション) in Japan.

region, home to over a hundred new and unique species of Pokemon. The Tandor region is known for its gym challenge: to qualify, trainers must collect 8 gym badges from around the region in order to compete in the prestigous Tandor Regional Tournament. Trainers that win the Tournament get a huge prize as well as world wide renown. \n \nYou, a 13-year-old kid from Moki Town, did not set out to become a Pokemon Master. After your mother Lucille died ten years ago in an accident at a nuclear power plant, your father Kellyn, the top Pokemon Ranger in the Tandor Ranger Union, left you with your elderly aunt and departed to travel the region. But now that you are grown up, your aunt can no longer support you. Out of a home, you did what most kids your age do and took up Pokémon training as a means to make a living. \n \nProfessor Bamb'o, regional expert on Pokémon elements, has been looking for a trainer assistant to travel the region and gather specimens of the varied wildlife. You step up to the challenge, along with your rival, a younger boy named Theo. After taking a test and receiving your starter Pokémon, you head towards your first gym challenge in Nowtoch city, and take your first steps exploring the Tandor region. \n \nThings aren't as sunny as they first seem, though. Just when the accident ten years ago had been all but forgotten, new mysteries emerge. A new power plant is built over the site of the old one. Your father begins acting strangely, journeying to the far reaches of the region and questioning whether your mother is really deceased. Sinister Pokemon, corrupted by nuclear radiation, threaten innocent people. In the midst ofthe turmoil, it seems that an impending disaster is looming over Tandor... You may be in for more than you expected.","rating":80.1082835416667,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":80.1082835416667,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":4,"games":[36792,25311,26163,37088,47823,16468,26766,1221,23719,25300],"tags":[17,18,268435468,268435487,536871321,536872059,1073741827],"developers":[11280],"publishers":[11280],"game_engines":[334],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[409,1147],"themes":[17,18],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":1470441600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1470441600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Aug-06","y":2016,"m":8}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"q8NxPo4S4To"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aghcsuy52tgtypdexhdp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aghcsuy52tgtypdexhdp","width":512,"height":384},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://uranium.amibu.net"},{"category":2,"url":"http://pokemon-uranium.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"}]},{"id":24950,"name":"Memory of a Broken Dimension","slug":"memory-of-a-broken-dimension","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/memory-of-a-broken-dimension","created_at":1476395166544,"updated_at":1523723203625,"summary":"You dredge the satellite transmission.

It was first released for Windows on April 28, 2005 in Japan.","storyline":"The game draws heavily from Welsh, Celt, Christian and Roman mythology, with characters named Arawn, Arthur, Epona, Llŷr, Morgan, Pwyll, Rhiannon, and Taliesin. Set in a Late Antiquity-inspired fantasy setting, story starts on an island Erin (or Hibernia, as shown on an in-game map) on the west border of the Holy Empire.\n\nPrologue is centered around the precognition-gifted priestess of the Gael tribe, Rhiannon. She is kidnapped by a rogue priest of the Holy Empire, Drwc, to be used as a sacrifice in a ritual meant to resurrect the Demon King Arawn and put Drwc in his favor. As a response the Gael people burn their village and swear to bring Rhiannon back or exact revenge on the Empire. In the middle of the ritual, as the Gael people attack Drwc's soldiers, Arawn is resurrected and offered Rhiannon. At this point, he kills Drwc, frees Rhiannon, and proclaims no intention in wreaking havoc which the legends attributed to him. Instead, he shows interest in Rhinannon's brother Arthur, the First Warrior of his tribe. Rhiannon, on the other hand, falls in love with Arawn, and by declaring her decision to marry him, makes him the chieftain of the Gael tribe (hers and Arthur's father was the previous chieftain, but Arthur could not assume the title due to being the First Warrior).\n\nAs the prologue ends, point of view is switched from Rhiannon to Arawn, revealing him to be the protagonist of the game, and the story continues with the exodus of Gael tribe to the neighboring island of Albion (or Insula Britannica, as shown on an in-game map) in hope of eluding the Empire.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22406,22426,19847,22480,22472,22470,22425,22481,22490,22482],"tags":[42,268435468,268435471,268435480,536870990,536871006,536871255,536871759,536871938,536874694,536875472,536878299],"developers":[3094],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,94,343,847,1026,3782,4560,7387],"themes":[42],"genres":[12,15,24],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Teiazu tou Teiara","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ueakthsivf2oarffnxke.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ueakthsivf2oarffnxke","width":788,"height":590},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kntjisqdufhz0mxhynib.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kntjisqdufhz0mxhynib","width":800,"height":600}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"Hf-PS3uHyE4"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t3po6cnjmrext9vtrmz8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t3po6cnjmrext9vtrmz8","width":230,"height":326},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_to_Tiara"}]},{"id":24956,"name":"Gurumin 3D: A Monstrous Adventure","slug":"gurumin-3d-a-monstrous-adventure","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gurumin-3d-a-monstrous-adventure","created_at":1476403823051,"updated_at":1530421382121,"summary":"\"A fun, colorful, and fast-paced Action-RPG from legendary Japanese developer Nihon Falcom.\n\nGurumin 3D features real-time combat, dazzling 3D graphics, 35+hours of playtime, fully voiced characters with an all-star cast of voice actors (including Tara Strong from My Little Pony: FiM), huge levels to explore, traps and puzzles to solve, treasure to discover, 90+ items, 5 difficulty levels, multiple endings, and a rockin’ soundtrack!\"","storyline":"\"Parin, a strong-willed girl sent to live with her grandfather in a small mining town.

is one of the most well-known fangames of the original Yume Nikki, made by lol. It's one of the darker spin-offs infamous for its eerie atmosphere and copious amounts of body horror and hospital imagery, centering around a girl named Sabitsuki (さびつき) as she enters her PC dreamworld to explore her mind and collect effects. \n.flow is one of the more traditional fangames that stays true to the gameplay elements of the original. Effects are collected in a gloomy, sublime dreamscape and the user is left to interpret the events and lack of explicit storyline. The only differences that seem to set this game apart from Yume Nikki is the more concrete subject matter (the deeper aspects of the landscape seem to have a more pristine resemblance to human body parts, where as Nikki's environment requires more interpretive thinking to analyze) and the inclusion of three endings instead of one. \n \nThe main plot of the game is similar to the original Yume Nikki's, in that it's a sandbox game with very few exploration restrictions. You must collect the twenty-five effects to unlock two of the three endings and three boxes to achieve the third.","storyline":"Much like Yume Nikki, little is known about the main protagonist, a girl named Sabitsuki, about whom very little is known. Similar to Madotsuki, the protagonist of Yume Nikki, Sabitsuki lives in an apartment with a bed, a single game console, a television, and most importantly, a personal computer which she uses to enter a state known as \"flow.\" While in flow, Sabitsuki (and the player) enter an surreal immersive reality linked to her psyche which she can explore in order to find 25 \"effects.\" Exactly who Sabitsuki is, what she has gone through, and even what kind of world she lives in is entirely up to the player to interpret based on what they see and experience while in flow.","collection":4261,"popularity":5.0,"games":[27266,13189,25646,28148,28277,63734,55289,26914,25222,72412],"tags":[19,268435487,268435488,536871070,536872220,536872405,536872475,536873789,536873796,1073741827],"developers":[14013],"publishers":[14013],"game_engines":[305],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[158,1308,1493,1563,2877,2884],"themes":[19],"genres":[31,32],"first_release_date":1234656000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1234656000000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Feb-15","y":2009,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h4pwhlth5z5oe9iudavb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h4pwhlth5z5oe9iudavb","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uat3296aoexlgbxsgnc1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uat3296aoexlgbxsgnc1","width":637,"height":478},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wyugnhkbhyipl8ib8ody.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wyugnhkbhyipl8ib8ody","width":632,"height":456}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"H_HcL2j71Jc"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lf4u5psskwf3vtjxhpbq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lf4u5psskwf3vtjxhpbq","width":320,"height":240},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://rustlimbo.webcrow.jp/games/flow/index.html"},{"category":2,"url":"http://dotflow.wikia.com/wiki/.flow_Wiki"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":1}]},{"id":24959,"name":"Pokémon Play It!

The terrorist cell, Fraction, is unforgiving, and it's reflected in the game with permadeath and autosaves to make going back on decisions impossible. You'll have to make difficult choices every day as the Commander of the UOD - but remember your ultimate goal is to protect civilians and to prevent panic and terror.\n\nYou can't do it alone. Using your limited funds, you must continually recruit and manage your team of professional bomb disposal experts, teach them to grow their skills, and to monitor channels and the map for suspicious activity.\n\n\nHire Screen\nYour team can get injured, get mentally stressed or ill, they can act erratically with other team members, they can lose their skills over time, and most importantly they can save the city. But it's up to you to manage which one can happen at any given time. Your team must gather Intel which can prevent terror attacks on and around the city, and allow you to send yourself or your team out on missions to diffuse bombs or arrest suspicious individuals in order to eradicate  the terrorist cell, Fraction, from the city.\n\nWho Are Fraction?\n \n\nFraction is a terrorist cell whose base of operation is somewhere within the city you reside over. They are made up of teams of hackers, bomb makers, and general anarchists whom have all come to the conclusion that in order to resolve issues of inequality and overpopulation, a vast majority of the population must be eradicated in order for humanity to continue at a diminished rate.\n\nThey see no other alternative, and while they originally set out to disrupt the accumulation of wealth for the richest 1%, they have slowly changed their doctrine to encumber more extremist measures, killing indiscriminately in order to incite fear and ultimately reduce the population down to a fraction of what it once was.\n\nFinding Fraction and Their Threats:\n\nAs your team gather Intel, you'll be able to pinpoint locations of interest, such as where Fractions Members meet, where they assemble bombs, and most immediately pressing, where they have planted a bomb.\n\nA Single District of the Map\nThe map consists of many districts, each with their own attributes, landmarks, municipals buildings, functions, and classes. This determines whether or not they are likely to be under immediate threat by Fraction, as the terrorist cell adopts a different tactic every other week to disrupt your operations, and eliminate human life.\n\nFor instance, as Fraction was founded upon disrupting the lives of the socially elite, they may initially still target richer districts at first. However, their tactics have grown so indiscriminate over time, that no where is safe.\n\nStory Building:\n\nIn \"Don't Go Bang!\" concerned citizens and members of UOD will email you regularly about the state of the city, and the state of your management skills. This is the primary way you directly build relationships in the game, with each email having multiple responses to cater to your own style of management, and your own intentions for how your relationship develops with that person. There is no \"Just Good\" or \"Just Bad\" answer. We want to embrace the grey area of dealing with a complex and frightening scenario.\n\nEmail System\nAs you build relationships, the content of each email differs as every person remembers who you are and what you've said. Choose to be unkind because you don't have the time, and it might come back to bite you later. Equally, be too soft and people might find it acceptable to walk all over you. Remember, YOU are in charge.\n\nUltimately, you are responsible for the protection of the city. As such, if you continue to fail on a regular basis, you will be petitioned to be replaced by the citizens of the city, as they work themselves into a panic and a frenzy. They will make life continually more difficult for you. If they succeed in having you removed from office, the game, and the city, is lost.\n\nDo not fail them. Do not fail your loved ones. Do not let Fraction win.\n\n\n\nCurrent Features: (In The Mobile Game)\n\nProcedural Bomb Generation\nWire Cutting Puzzle Variations (Cut All Yellow Wires, Cut Third Wires etc.)\nMultiple Tiers Per Bomb (Multiple Levels/Sections to each bomb.)\nPlanned Features: (For The PC Game)\n\nMassively improved visuals - We'll be able to hire an artist better than ourselves to give the games art a complete overhaul to capture the intensity of the situation, whilst still capturing the games dark humour moments too.\nPanic - The purpose of the game is to respond to terrorist threats, suspected/potential/otherwise. Failure to do so will result in increased panic in the city, and as this grows the citizens can petition to have your funds lowered, or to have you removed completely, resulting in Game Over.\nComplex Bomb Disposal - With the limitation of a single tap used in mobile games being lifted, we can make the bomb disposal process much more complex and interesting. This includes requiring certain tools to perform certain actions.\nRules/Instructions - The rules of bomb disposal will change depending on how quickly Fraction is improving their bomb making skills. It's upto your team to gather Intel to give you the new list of instructions as quickly as possible. E.g. You may be told to always cut the first red wire, and then one day that rules changes...\nFull Map - A huge interactive Map with different districts that have different functions for the city. As events/festivals/celebrations come up, the population density of an area may change, and you'll have to work harder to protect these areas.\nManage and Build your team - Hire people you trust and build them up to be the best they can be at bomb disposal. You cannot afford to use them sparingly, but be careful as once they're dead, they stay dead.\nConnection to the Citizens - You receive regular emails and communications from concerned or supportive citizens in the city regarding the recent events. You can make dialogue decisions on how well you should inform the public or build relationships with people. Be careful though, as you fail missions, those you care about can perish.\nShop - You are able to customise your office space that you work in, as well as buy new equipment for yourself and your crew.\nResearch - As Fraction grows, and their bomb making prowess increases, it’s your job to stay one step ahead, so you’d have to recruit avid researchers to provide you with the latest tools and equipment to deal with the threats.\nScanner/Send Investigation Team – As briefly mentioned, the map displays information about the city currently, but in order to find bombs there has to be a process to do so. You can do this by scanning for suspicious signals, or physically sending an investigation team (at your expense) to reconnoitre the area and report back if there are threats or potential threats.\n\n\nBreakdown of Funds for Don't Go Bang!\nPart of our commitment to being open and honest regarding everything about this endeavour means going over exactly where your pledges will be going towards. On our part, we've designed the game for a long time, and came up with exactly what it is and could be back when it was a mobile game, and what it is now! \nAs such, you might be wondering while Design gets less of a cut than Art and Programming, but the truth is we did a lot of the Design work off our own funds, but it still needs Playtesting which comes under Design, and also various tweaks - a lot of the time a Programmer makes it work, but a Designer makes it feel right. Equally, while the Writing Budget is low, it's because this also comes under Design at times, so it's actually difficult to pinpoint.\n\n\n We'll be humbled immensely if we reach our goal of £20,000, but if the unimaginable were to happen and we go beyond that, we've carefully selected a number of stretch goals to help make \"Don't Go Bang!\" an even better experience.\n\n\nStretch Goals for Don't Go Bang!\nEither way, we'll strive to make \"Don't Go Bang!\" an amazing experience, with incredible gameplay and an engaging, unforgettable story.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,16468,23175,2015,40524,59516,28029,36594,68324],"tags":[41,20,1,268435467,1073741830,1073741827,1073741825],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,3,6],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,20,41],"genres":[11],"status":2,"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dwifnz8zmjrbfgdibrl4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dwifnz8zmjrbfgdibrl4","width":8192,"height":4280},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lgk7r4by8qrs51zxqsxw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lgk7r4by8qrs51zxqsxw","width":680,"height":379},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bhkqbfsaaimna4rdz9fx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bhkqbfsaaimna4rdz9fx","width":680,"height":680},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ywvd5s0luafz3cfjgoru.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ywvd5s0luafz3cfjgoru","width":680,"height":380},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cfwdvylcooy9ki7vqb0f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cfwdvylcooy9ki7vqb0f","width":680,"height":384}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bga3m2nc4k3sb5ld0x0i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bga3m2nc4k3sb5ld0x0i","width":8192,"height":4280},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https://www.dalriadagames.com/dontgobang"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/dalriadaconnor"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/DalriadaGames/"}]},{"id":24967,"name":"Polynomial 2","slug":"polynomial-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/polynomial-2","created_at":1476473010767,"updated_at":1523414317779,"summary":"Music.

He also must navigate the politics of the other Zipang warlords.\"","rating":80.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":62.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":71.33333333333334,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":0,"games":[22387,19301,17130,34823,18918,19934,19376,13200,17111,29173],"tags":[18,39,268435469,268435471,268435472,268435480,268435488,536870913,536870990,536871029,536871327,536872460,536873287,536873337,536873625,536873822,536874694,536875043,536875046,536875066,536875171,536875307,1073741827],"developers":[11301,11302],"publishers":[13648],"game_engines":[396,6],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,78,117,415,1548,2375,2425,2713,2910,3782,4131,4134,4154,4259,4395],"themes":[18,39],"genres":[13,15,16,24,32],"first_release_date":1513814400000,"pulse_count":25,"platforms":[6,14,48,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1513814400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-21","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1513814400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-21","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1513814400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-21","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1513814400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-21","y":2017,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xjjs0c4ogbtkwammruk1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xjjs0c4ogbtkwammruk1","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zuwfppekbwsbg3mnhivm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zuwfppekbwsbg3mnhivm","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jnwtox1gt9ssi0ng0zmw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jnwtox1gt9ssi0ng0zmw","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fjb9kdy3wlg86sdkdyb9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fjb9kdy3wlg86sdkdyb9","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z6e60theamryad0k1fsq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z6e60theamryad0k1fsq","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uhixy3wygoydfxlmaufx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uhixy3wygoydfxlmaufx","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cnxkojwetmnartts8bdc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cnxkojwetmnartts8bdc","width":1920,"height":1079},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/m9naexzyhkpthb3mranj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m9naexzyhkpthb3mranj","width":1920,"height":1079},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xwqeijmpdilqzlj0csri.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xwqeijmpdilqzlj0csri","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c3tygpii8tperfaenst8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c3tygpii8tperfaenst8","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ehrrulcfjns7rkyd3cqm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ehrrulcfjns7rkyd3cqm","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"MEuMB_JZwm8"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"KJ-WZmt2tcI"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/grecuwjoiqfzxvmouhpa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"grecuwjoiqfzxvmouhpa","width":1200,"height":675},"esrb":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/tinymetalgame"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/751500"},{"category":1,"url":"http://tinymetal.com/"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/tinymetalgame"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/tinymetalgame/"}],"external":{"steam":"751500"}},{"id":24975,"name":"Headmaster","slug":"headmaster","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/headmaster","created_at":1476549735835,"updated_at":1534366100357,"summary":"Welcome to the Football Improvement Centre, which is not a prison.

The goal for each stage is to get to the end of the stage as fast as possible without falling, getting killed or depleting your sanity gauge.\n\nCentral to Until I Have You is the exoskeleton suit. The suit gives the player special abilities at the cost of the player's sanity. The exoskeleton comes with the abilities to slow down time, ala Max Payne and to rewind time. However, overuse of these abilities will cause the sanity bar to deplete making your character lose touch with reality. When the sanity bar depletes your character starts to hallucinate, altering gameplay mechanics and level design.\n\nIn each stage, the player navigates his way from left to right through platforming sections, death traps, and enemies. The goal is to do this as fast as possible with the least amount of deaths. The fast pace of the game can make it difficult to plan a perfect approach. To make up for this, the game allows the player to restart each stage the moment they die, allowing them to quickly fine-tune their approach over several attempts. At the end of each chapter the player must also defeat a unique boss. Along the way the player acquires a number of weapons and upgrades that you can cycle through, all of which have a specific use.\n\nThe game grades the player's performance at the end of each stage based on a number of factors and given a percentage raring out of 100. Things you get judged on include method of death, whether you kill any of the enemies and what you killed them with.","storyline":"Until I Have You, is a story-driven, fast-paced, retro-aesthetic platformer, engulfed in a Cyberpunk setting.\n\nDriving you to the edge of your seat as you run n' gun through enemies, the game recounts a thrilling story of regret, love and corruption, in a city that’s gone haywire and just doesn't give a damn.\n\nThis is the story of the ARTIST, a talented assassin, who has worked many dirty jobs in a long and successful career. Finally heeding the pleadings of his wife, he has decided it's time to quit this ugly business and live a simple and peaceful life. However the ARTIST’s clients know he is irreplaceable, and are unwilling to allow the craftsman to hangup his tool belt. They send him this message by kidnapping his wife, Emily, and make it clear, retirement is not an option! The ARTIST is determined to get his wife back, and prepares himself for one last assignment. He understands to be successful he needs to go all out, and he procures a rare exoskeleton suit. Although this provides him with additional powers, it also can cause hallucinations and affect his judgment.\n\nIf you could save someone, how much of yourself would you be willing to sacrifice?","hypes":2,"rating":60.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":60.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[16468,55289,10039,25311,55752,19174,47823,34919,25300,36608],"tags":[1,268435464,268435468,268435488,536871015,536871127,536871156,536872048,536872961,1073741828],"developers":[3188],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[103,215,244,1136,2049],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,12,32],"first_release_date":1459728000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1459728000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Apr-04","y":2016,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1459728000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Apr-04","y":2016,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1459728000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Apr-04","y":2016,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tsx9zslpurv8nw1yf5qk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tsx9zslpurv8nw1yf5qk","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sz4eghphra6hwp6zo6dq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sz4eghphra6hwp6zo6dq","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xw2v81uwcerbkbsgwxo5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xw2v81uwcerbkbsgwxo5","width":1920,"height":1200},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gv5ibckg9qlytpixk2xg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gv5ibckg9qlytpixk2xg","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/riuiwphka6pnm7zdrgsb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"riuiwphka6pnm7zdrgsb","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"k_TWJgDL5mU"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nvhzpqgzmvstl5noubus.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nvhzpqgzmvstl5noubus","width":616,"height":353},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/439310"},{"category":1,"url":"http://untilihaveyou.com/"}],"external":{"steam":"439310"}},{"id":24978,"name":"Contra Force","slug":"contra-force","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/contra-force","created_at":1476556293238,"updated_at":1526044456105,"summary":"Contra Force is an action shooting game released by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 in North America.

Published by HOT・B, it is based on their earlier 1984 cyberpunk-themed computer role-playing game Psychic City. \n \nThe game is set in a decadent cyberpunk-style future world in which everyone has extrasensory perception. These powers can also be used by the player characters when they confront the various monsters in the game through combat. The eventual target of the game is to defeat the villains. In order to accomplish this, the player's characters must go to the Ark City and eventually to outer space. Unlike the Final Fantasy series, the game does not give the player an automatic \"game over\" when it is impossible to win the battle. This makes it possible for players to accidentally walk into a walking dead situation every time they are forced to do battle with the game's monsters.","collection":4388,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[26766,25300,1877,19099,36950,12632,11567,27920,29147,19301],"tags":[18,268435468,536870990,536871015,536871487,536871835,536871851,536871882,536871938,536872124,536872139,536872229,536872258,536872699,536872793,536876495,536876712,536876875,536877514,536877691,536879912,536880253,536880607,1073741827],"developers":[11310,11311],"publishers":[11310],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,103,575,923,939,970,1026,1212,1227,1317,1346,1787,1881,5583,5800,5963,6602,6779,9000,9341,9695],"themes":[18],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":562291200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":562291200000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Oct-27","y":1987,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"星をみるひと","comment":"Japanese

64, Atari 8-bit family, and Apple II series released in 1983. It was later released for the IBM PC. The game was created by noted game designer Sid Meier, and published by MicroProse Software, which Meier founded in 1982 with Bill Stealey. The mission of the game is to fly solo over several states, delivering bags of mail. The game supported a fairly realistic flight model (for the time), and a large number of flight instruments were available. A map covering many states of the US was used, which even included altitude data (although the landscape always appeared flat due to the technology constraints of the time).","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[44242,40470,18623,22470,29173,26145,22425,55689,55590,54789],"tags":[32,268435466,268435469,536870968,536872060,536874337,536875117,1073741825],"developers":[9150],"publishers":[13807,9150],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[56,1148,3425,4205],"themes":[32],"genres":[10,13],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[156,13,65,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":156,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hzv1hezbrezzatcl1gxa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hzv1hezbrezzatcl1gxa","width":1000,"height":1418}},{"id":25038,"name":"The Coveted Mirror","slug":"the-coveted-mirror","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-coveted-mirror","created_at":1476703099700,"updated_at":1517270606337,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[236,36792,26163,23719,1221,37088,47823,26848,19289,18398],"tags":[17,268435487,536871130,1073741829,1073741826],"publishers":[6405],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[218],"themes":[17],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[75],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g7xonvc2yzn8txy69nh8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g7xonvc2yzn8txy69nh8","width":800,"height":1114}},{"id":25039,"name":"Chase: Cold Case Investigations ~Distant Memories~","slug":"chase-cold-case-investigations-~distant-memories~","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chase-cold-case-investigations-~distant-memories~","created_at":1476703388276,"updated_at":1518052514668,"summary":"A hard-boiled detective game being created by former CiNG developers at Arc System Works for the Nintendo 3DS.

Players use a wand to fire fantastical blasts at ghostly figures, spiders, trolls, giant snakes, and other wizards. Characters screech or cry out in pain when hit, and often break apart into smaller Lego pieces when defeated. Players sometimes engage in one-on-one wand duels that are accompanied by colorful explosions. In one cutscene, a character's body explodes, and the central character cradles the head piece; another sequence depicts a dragon impaled through the mouth by a sword. In one sequence, brown Lego droppings fall out of a creature's posterior; a character scoops up the droppings with a shovel and remarks with a comical “Pee-ewhh” gesture.","rating":4},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":48,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0},{"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":25084,"name":"SHENZHEN I/O","slug":"shenzhen-i-slash-o","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shenzhen-i-slash-o","created_at":1476910493131,"updated_at":1523383996807,"summary":"\"BUILD CIRCUITS.

K. Rowling as a companion to the Harry Potter series and as a followup to the Wonderbook's debut title, Book of Spells. It was released in Europe on 15 November 2013[2] and North America on 12 November 2013, alongside Diggs Nightcrawler and Walking with Dinosaurs.","storyline":"The Book of Potions was written somewhen in the 16th century by Zygmunt Budge, an exceptionally talented potioneer who, after leaving Hogwarts at the age of 14, moved to the Outer Hebridean island of Hermetray where he lived alone, continuing his potioneering studies.[2]\n\nApproximately 500 years after his death, a Gryffindor student, Harry Potter, aged 11, somehow comes into possession of the Book of Potions at the Hogwarts library, finding that some of Zygmunt's personality lives on within its pages. Under his tutelage, the student begins their ascent to potioneering mastery. After successfully brewing an introductory boil-curing potion for Sirius's house elf, Kreacher, Harry finds that they have somehow been entered into the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship, a septennial contest between students from magic schools across the globe. But it's not going to be easy, because Lord Voldemort has come to kill Cedric Diggory, a Hufflepuff student and Harry will need Sirius Black to help him out.\n\nWith Sirius Black's help, Harry brews various potions to overcome the obstacles standing between them and the Golden Cauldron, which, after brewing and imbibing Sirius's self-proclaimed finest work, Felix Felicis, they successfully obtain. Having done so, Harry earns the right to use the cauldron to brew a new potion all their own. After finding some exceptionally rare ingredients, Harry brews a potion which is revealed to be the \"Potion of All Potential\", which enables its drinker to reach their highest capability.\n\nSirius Black initially comes off as warped and slightly mad, thinking of little but the Golden Cauldron, but, as the student's potioneering skills improve, he finds himself warming to them, eventually revealing exactly why he left Hogwarts: as a student, Zygmunt asked the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, if he could enter the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship despite being six years below the minimum age for entry, but he was denied, being told that it was too dangerous. Unable to accept this, Sirius immediately left the school in protest, which disabled him from entering the Championship even once he had come of age.\n\nOnce Harry wins the golden cauldron and defends Cedric Diggory from Lord Voldemort's dark magic, Zygmunt's spirit finds itself at peace, and he congratulates them wholeheartedly for both obtaining it and brewing the Potion of All Potential. Saying that he'll no longer cause trouble for anyone else, he leaves the student to meet their \"adoring public\".","collection":2482,"franchise":133,"franchises":[133],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68324,19698,22191,47823,26766,64061,64550,36926,12632,39257],"tags":[34,536871208,536871363,536871895,536873857,536875349,536876218,536877033],"developers":[1033],"publishers":[4897],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,451,983,2945,4437,5306,6121],"themes":[34],"first_release_date":1384214400000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1384214400000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Nov-12","y":2013,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1384473600000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Nov-15","y":2013,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ryyxgjvemskxq0jjrxyk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ryyxgjvemskxq0jjrxyk","width":1536,"height":864},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ghxcjgsax8tl4fopkpbt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ghxcjgsax8tl4fopkpbt","width":1920,"height":1096},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qjddo8fjlpu7s6vgueno.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qjddo8fjlpu7s6vgueno","width":1737,"height":983},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eoxqodbxialen5guokby.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eoxqodbxialen5guokby","width":1920,"height":1096}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"439opcIxxig"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"8BNIEtBtiGY"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ymuec5bky7kzpsnpnox4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ymuec5bky7kzpsnpnox4","width":1000,"height":1179},"esrb":{"rating":4}},{"id":25100,"name":"Luminous Arc 3","slug":"luminous-arc-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/luminous-arc-3","created_at":1477070132967,"updated_at":1500366924440,"summary":"Luminous Arc 3 (ルミナスアーク3 アイズ Ruminasu Āku Tsū Aizu?, Luminous Arc 3: Eyes) is a role-playing video game developed by imageepoch and published by Marvelous Entertainment.

The most exalted prize of the forest. Only the greatest of hunters can hope to claim its head. \nIt's rather unfortunate to know that such a man is the one pursuing you. \n \nBut what is this? As you traverse the forest, a darker reality will be unveiled. \nBlood-soaked liaisons, sorrow, hatred and lust all melded together in the life of your pursuer. \nCould it be? \nIs it even possible to think that the hunter may have deeper reasons for pursuing you aside from pride? \n \nThe Hunt was made in the RPG Maker VX Ace engine. It contains puzzles, chases, and multiple endings. Your choices throughout the game will not only determine what ending you'll get but will also change some of the dialogue and gameplay along the way. \n \n{I wanted to include a hand-painted animation at one of the endings and promised to have it in the release. While I have kept true to my word, I could only include a small snippet of what I'd been planning and (as much as it shames me to admit), touched it up digitally. I sincerely want to show the full animation I'd been working on and will try to finish it in the future.} \n \nMade in a similar vein to classic pixel games, The Hunt will not hold your hand. Your brain and eyes will be tested throughout the game so keep both sharp. The game is designed to allow the player to skip over large amounts of exploration and puzzles if they want to simply escape the forest. However, if you want to know what's going on, you will have to look carefully. It's easy to miss or simply gloss over important items, information, clues, and hints. \n \nAt the start of the game, you will be provided with the choice of displaying NOTES. NOTES in the game provide information that will make your progression easier. If you don't enable NOTES, you may encounter surprises, but it will allow you to have a more challenging and potentially more fun experience. Ultimately it depends on what you as the gamer would prefer, easy progression or immersive gameplay. Keep in mind that the NOTES for the most part will only provide information on how to escape. They will not provide a lot of information towards finding secret endings or information. \n \nThere are seven different endings.

The game was expanded upon in 1977, with help from Don Woods, and other programmers created variations on the game and ports to other systems in the following years.\n\nIn the game, the player controls a character through simple text commands to explore a cave rumored to be filled with wealth. Players earn predetermined points for acquiring treasure and escaping the cave alive, with the goal to earn the maximum amount of points offered. The concept bore out from Crowther's background as a caving enthusiast, with the game's cave structured loosely around the Mammoth Cave system in Kentucky.\n\nColossal Cave Adventure is the first known work of interactive fiction and, as the first text adventure game, is considered the precursor for the adventure game genre. Colossal Cave Adventure also contributed towards the role playing and roguelike genres.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[13189,22425,25222,41895,55803,26766,47823,25211,36926,11296],"tags":[268435487,536871130,536871208,536871516,536871939,536872287,536872668,536873308,536875172,536876005,536876610,1073741829],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"keywords":[218,296,604,1027,1375,1756,2396,4260,5093,5698],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":252374400000,"platforms":[96,13,75,126],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":96,"date":252374400000,"region":2,"human":"1977","y":1977,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":126,"date":347068800000,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":347068800000,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":378604800000,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Microsoft Adventure","comment":"Other"},{"name":"ADVENT"},{"name":"Colossal Cave"},{"name":"Adventure"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p1dwjzwpznmcg8fimla3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p1dwjzwpznmcg8fimla3","width":668,"height":501}},{"id":25116,"name":"The Miser's House","slug":"the-misers-house","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-misers-house","created_at":1477138854592,"updated_at":1477150824284,"summary":"This game was first released as MISER for the Commodore PET in 1981.

It all started after Jesus heard rumor at school about some \"Hidden entrance in the mountains\", so he thought it would be interesting to check it out and maybe bring his friends with him. So he asks his friends and they all agree to go, even if the walk was painful and long. After what seemed like hours of searching and walking. They finally found the mountain with the entrance, but it was really more of a small cave. Eventually the reach a dead end and they all decide to leave, except for Jesus, he wanted to stay because there had to be something else. After screaming \"Guys!\" for a long time, he gets angry and stomps, Hard! The floor collapses and reveals a small abandoned shaft. Since the only way out was to climb and they didn't want to do anymore climbing, they went and looked around the shaft and found a door with weird inscriptions written on it. It turned out to be a puzzle, after the puzzle was solved, the door opened and revealed a passage way that lead to 8 pillars with stones on each one, except for a red one, a stone was missing. They all decided to take a stone with them. They all climb to the top of the pillar they all chose and grabbed the stone, but as soon as they touched them, they dissolved into their skin and began to glow. After about 2 minutes of glowing and floating slowly, they tried to figure out what happened. Jesus tried to get up, but as soon as he did...he flew in the air while leaving a really light blue trial from his hand, then it all became clear, it turned out that the stones they collected were elemental stones. They all wanted to be sure that they are careful with their \"Newfound Powers\", so they all went into different tunnels and began to test them out. Jesus didn't want to practice yet, he wanted to look around the shaft and manged to find something interesting, he found the missing stone. He told every body and they all decided to put the stone back on the pedestal. So they went back to the pathway and Jesus climbed up the red pillar and put the stone back on. As soon as he did, he flew and hit the wall! Now i know what you're thinking, \"He probably got more power\", no, instead he slowly turned into something else, he turned into the ancient demon, Nightmare, and chased them all out of the shaft and out of the mountain. He left behind a trial of blood and the other 6 were covered in blood. This is where they had to get back home fast, they had to go at godspeed because the mountains were in a nearby neighborhood and some of the neighbors began to call the police. After running about 1-3 miles, they finally made it back and cleaned themselves. They then were thinking about what they were gonna do since Jesus turned into a monster and is gone. They decide to turn on the TV and see a news report about a monster flying around and opening portals. They then knew what they had to do, they had stop the thing that Jesus turned into, but the thing is that when they left they cave, Nightmare stole their stones and hid them. Now they had to find them ,stop Nightmare, and free Jesus before its too late.","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25311,36609,37088,23175,25300,59516,55289,16999,37022,25646],"tags":[1,38,268435460,268435471,268435487,1073741829,1073741826],"developers":[11345],"publishers":[11345],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,5],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1,38],"genres":[4,15,31],"status":5,"alternative_names":[{"name":"N:TEC","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qudbwxurajelcado8n2i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qudbwxurajelcado8n2i","width":1366,"height":597},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ruiz9f1fytazznnhqpyq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ruiz9f1fytazznnhqpyq","width":1918,"height":908}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jxfwrgtleqqopwm2hley.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jxfwrgtleqqopwm2hley","width":1080,"height":1300},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":3}},{"id":25124,"name":"Candy Gliders","slug":"candy-gliders","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/candy-gliders","created_at":1477197358342,"updated_at":1517270858293,"summary":"Aliens are stealing candies from Candy Forest !

The game features two campaigns based around the events in southern Russia between summer 1942 and early 1943. The game has two playable modes, first one is by default the RKKA (Workers' and Peasants' Red Army) campaign which follows the Red Army's progress as it liberated Stalingrad and destroyed the 6th Army. And the second mode is the Wehrmacht campaign, which has the player commanding the 6th Army as it approached the city and the battles for the city itself. The game maps themselves are reproduced from historical tactical maps and actual aerial photography taken during the period that the campaign covers.","storyline":"This game is based on real life historical events.\nYear 1942. Stalingrad, Soviet Union. We are on one of the major battle on the Eastern Front of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fight the Soviet Union for the control of the Stalingrad City  (now Volgograd) in Southern Russia, on the eastern boundary of Europe.\n\nMarked by fierce close quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians by air raids, it is often regarded as one of the single largest (nearly 2.2 million personnel) and bloodiest (1.7–2 million wounded, killed or captured) battles in the history of warfare. The heavy losses inflicted on the German Wehrmacht make it arguably the most strategically decisive battle of the whole war.\nIt was a turning point in the European theatre of World War II; German forces never regained the initiative in the East and withdrew a vast military force from the West to replace their losses.\n\nThe German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in August 1942, using the German 6th Army and elements of the 4th Panzer Army. The attack was supported by intensive Luftwaffe bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into house-to-house fighting, and both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the Volga River.\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the Red Army launched Operation Uranus, a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker Romanian and Hungarian armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.\nThe Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was cut off and surrounded in the Stalingrad area. Adolf Hitler ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By early February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining units of the 6th Army surrendered. The battle lasted five months, one week, and three days.","rating":70.0,"popularity":3.0,"total_rating":70.0,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":1,"games":[22399,83728,17446,36594,289,37059,27092,55036,23345,27091],"tags":[1,22,39,268435471,536870931,536871595,536872288,536872300,536873354,536873876,536874694,536875137,536878025,1073741827],"developers":[11347],"publishers":[11348,157],"game_engines":[182],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[19,683,1376,1388,2442,2964,3782,4225,7113],"themes":[1,22,39],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":1112227200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":3,"platform":6,"date":1112227200000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Q1","y":2005,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Great Battles of WWII: Stalingrad"},{"name":"Сталинград","comment":"Original Name"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/orwnrcxsn2yqgdzqoa7b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"orwnrcxsn2yqgdzqoa7b","width":1600,"height":1024},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v8nogczvhxmqqtckcaz9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v8nogczvhxmqqtckcaz9","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/u7inc2kgw3imtbimva2h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u7inc2kgw3imtbimva2h","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dvy4dzs7o8ezeko6pmai.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvy4dzs7o8ezeko6pmai","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k096f9e7sajq89kublic.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k096f9e7sajq89kublic","width":1024,"height":768}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"FLlQZrSJH6g"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g7dxoojrz47dp1zmavic.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g7dxoojrz47dp1zmavic","width":1200,"height":1715},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/356260"}],"external":{"steam":"356260"}},{"id":25126,"name":"Chess","slug":"chess--1","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chess--1","created_at":1477209975660,"updated_at":1516729014180,"summary":"Chess was written in March, 1980 and converted to IBM PC in December, 1981.

Paratroopers are jumping down from those helicopters; if four or more of them touch the ground, they will form a human ladder, climb up to the turret, and destroy it. To avoid that, the player has to shoot either the paratroopers themselves or their parachutes - for different effects but the same results.\n\nAfter the player has withstood several waves of helicopters, bomber planes start appearing. These planes shoot bombs directly at the turret, which do not miss and destroy it right away. To counter that, the player can either eliminate the plane before it has the chance to drop the bomb, or destroy the bomb itself in mid-air. Shooting bombs scores the most points (50).\n\nSurviving this stage effectively puts the game on an indefinite loop, with more helicopter and bomber plane stages alternating with increased difficulty.

Game is currently in early development with set goals.           \n                    \n           \n* PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD - You will play a robot as the main protagonist of Floatlands, going up against other robots. Game world will consist of several biomes: jungle, desert, sea and snow. These worlds will be unique all the time because they will be randomly generated. Islands and natural elements will have certain similarities, but altogether the world will be unique every time.           \n           \nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scorched-sunset-lowpoly-floatlands.png           \n               \n           \n* QUESTING, POINTS OF INTEREST - There will be random events/quests (defending, collecting, exploring) across the world for you to complete. Quests, missions will also be randomly generated in order to bring the unpredictability aspect to the game.           \n           \nhttps://i0.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/quest-character-lowpoly-floatlands-2.png           \n           \n                    \n* PLAYING STYLES - You can choose different play styles when playing in the world of Floatlands. You can be an explorer or you can be an aggressive player that wants to eliminate threats of well being.           \n                    \n                    \n* RESOURCE GATHERING - Important part will be the resource gathering aspect. Some basics: Shooting down robot enemies will provide you scrap metal; by chopping trees you will gain wood; sheep is a source for wool; you will also find resources in caves. Certain materials need to be processed and smelted in order to be used for building structures. \n \n* CUSTOM BUILD MODE - With gathered resources you’ll be able to build and upgrade your own custom base/shelter and defend from enemies. At this moment there are 50 different build parts you can use to build your base. There are also 3 tiers – wood (starting tier), stone and fortified stone (highest tier for now). Build mode mixed with random generated terrain provides a multitude of options (basic shacks, castles…), so it will be interesting in this regard. \n \n* ELECTRIC SYSTEM - One other major feature in game is electricity which will provide you with different options in the game - repairing your robot, powering up the lights and your defense system (turrets). We are in the process of making various props that will need a source of energy. Generators will be that source and with cables you'll have the option to connect devices yourself.  You will have to fill generators with fuel to get them to work. \n \nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/electricity_connection_lowpoly_floatlands.png","storyline":"Your character is the last non-corrupted and reworked robot that was used for ordinary chores and to help human progress.

The game contains language such as \"a*s\" and \"hell\" and crude humor such as \"humidifier full of urine,\" \"an avalanche of doggy poo,\" and \"dry heave or juicy fart?\"","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\nIt contains: Mild bad language","rating":3}},{"id":25218,"name":"Outreach","slug":"outreach","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/outreach","created_at":1477369115442,"updated_at":1534411408583,"summary":"Outreach is a Cold War conspiracy thriller that employs an authentic zero gravity movement system.

The game was first announced in June 2006, by which time it was reported to already have been in production and self-funded for two years; the title was then signed with Sega in 2007, but in July 2009 it was revealed that the game had been cancelled by the publisher earlier that year after over half a decade of work, as noted in the LinkedIn profile of a former internal producer at the studio. Further details surrounding the cancellation and the game's fate in their entirety remain unclear to this day, as no official announcement regarding its status has been made by either Sega or Edge of Reality, however, more recently, a U.S. federal trademark registration was filed on September 11, 2009, which as of October 19, 2011, has been granted a third extension. While confirming nothing else, this does indicate that Edge of Reality has retained the intellectual property rights to the game.\n\nAlthough the game was widely believed to be permanently cancelled by Sega, game designer Phil Fogerite (who worked as level designer on the project from March 2008 to April 2009) has most recently stated that Edge of Reality itself had in fact decided to put the game on indefinite hold.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36813,313,3201,26192,15536,7350,1905,19441,1011,21429],"tags":[1,23,536871044,536871139,536872131,536872205,536872578,536875157,536875229,536875249,536875420,536875464,536875483,536875572,536875621,536875624,536875804,536875822,536876221,536876363,536876687,536876853,536876911,536877204,536877264,536877312,536877950,536879881,536883995],"category":0,"keywords":[132,227,1219,1293,1666,4245,4317,4337,4508,4552,4571,4660,4709,4712,4892,4910,5309,5451,5775,5941,5999,6292,6352,6400,7038,8969,13083],"themes":[1,23],"status":6,"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"th_dd_0hhzs"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/siwtwgdczl52swdod5pt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"siwtwgdczl52swdod5pt","width":264,"height":264}},{"id":25227,"name":"El Hijo","slug":"el-hijo","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/el-hijo","created_at":1477406421947,"updated_at":1533894311431,"summary":"El Hijo is a spaghetti western, indie stealth game. \nThe game is set in a mythical place of the 19th century that very much resembles the American west, as we know it from Sergio Leone‘s westerns, taking some of its most popular characteristics of outlaw gangs, saloons, cunning, sarcasm, irony, etc. There is no indication of a specific time, or place.

But behind the scenes, the forgotten group once known as The Terrorforce has reawakened and are using divide and conquer tactics to destabilize the world’s economic, social, and political norms. Tensions are rising between the many races of the world but luckily a small number of people remember the past and are determined to not let history repeat itself. \n \nTowards The Pantheon is a 2D top down role-playing game in development where players journey through lush forests, freezing plains of snow, dystopian cyberpunk cities, and barren wastelands to find and defeat the source of The Terrorforce at The Pantheon. \n \nGone are the RPG clichés of potions, wars between elemental gods, and the journey where someone accidentally stumbles upon a unique magical power that enables only them to save the world. Instead Towards The Pantheon is a unique and unusual game that follows the unlikely team of Freyja the warrior, Bam the cat, Mishima the cyborg, and Phenez the dead on their simultaneously lighthearted, fun, dark, and painful journey. \n \nDrawing inspiration from a variety of classics ranging from Paper Mario, Silent Hill, and Golden Sun, Towards The Pantheon is a personal game that is currently aiming for a Summer 2017 release. \n \nFeatures: \n \n- Ability to switch between the four main characters, each with unique overworld mechanics. \n- Turn based combat system where each character has unique battle mechanics. \n- A huge fully connected overworld with an additional transportation system. \n- More than 10 regions to explore including lush forests, freezing snow lands, cyberpunk cities, barren wastelands, and a desolate mansion. \n- Dialog and support systems that allow for further character development and stat boosts. \n- A full original soundtrack that combines modern production techniques with SNES/GBC/Genesis era synthesizers. The soundtrack will be released as both an Original Soundtrack (~70 minutes) and Complete Soundtrack (containing every song in the game). \n- A unique and complex overarching storyline that ties together over 5 races spanning over 10 regions, each contributing to a deep and rich lore.","hypes":1,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":55.0,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":55.0,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[25311,47823,3231,25921,23733,14760,102869,19448,36534,27092],"tags":[17,18,19,268435468,268435471,268435472,268435487,268435488,536870990,536871029,536871043,536871135,536871200,536871208,536871337,536871350,536871390,536871393,536871415,536871433,536872032,536872070,536872617,536873174,536873405,536873475,536873491,536873492,536873639,536873666,1073741827],"game_engines":[79],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,117,131,223,288,296,425,438,478,481,503,521,1120,1158,1705,2262,2493,2563,2579,2580,2727,2754],"themes":[17,18,19],"genres":[12,15,16,31,32],"first_release_date":1508889600000,"status":2,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1508889600000,"human":"2017-Oct-25","y":2017,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1508889600000,"human":"2017-Oct-25","y":2017,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1508889600000,"human":"2017-Oct-25","y":2017,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f57a0ue0qrsrnyiydxuk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f57a0ue0qrsrnyiydxuk","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jrnpysyirgcf8y2rzuka.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jrnpysyirgcf8y2rzuka","width":833,"height":521},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xuyzvdmvjytpjmptudma.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xuyzvdmvjytpjmptudma","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xj9pwcwdcbonrt5igzxa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xj9pwcwdcbonrt5igzxa","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fqu59pyatrlogd2jka9y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fqu59pyatrlogd2jka9y","width":1344,"height":768}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"_8tQTkdZf2A"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/di0cywjpo5obrldqulul.jpg","cloudinary_id":"di0cywjpo5obrldqulul","width":1080,"height":1920},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/709510"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.towardsthepantheon.com"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/TowardsThePantheon/"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/PantheonDev"}],"external":{"steam":"709510"}},{"id":25317,"name":"Krampus","slug":"krampus","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/krampus","created_at":1477757833664,"updated_at":1523372332498,"summary":"You play as a teenager, who along with his family went to a country house to celebrate Christmas.

By the time the player arrives police are already on the scene, his old friend, Emre, has run away. Players must use their investigative skills in order to uncover the secret he struggled, but failed, to reveal. Failure could mean death.\n\nThe game plays in a typical first-person adventure fashion, providing 360º of freedom of movement around the player, as well as the ability to look up and down. Locations are presented as static images and talking is handled similar to that in the Tex Murphy series, with live cast and photo realistic surroundings. The game incorporates details of Turkey's history, as well as that of Southeastern Europe and so the player will have to make use of an abnormal piece of technology to investigate through the past and save yourself in the present, uncovering the secrets that lie behind Emre's disappearance.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,18011,13189,236,60,29526,21641,51524,54678,26223],"tags":[22,34,43,268435458,268435465,268435487,536871446,536871939,536872350,536872640,536872830,536873336,536873917,536875426,1073741825],"developers":[11417],"publishers":[11418],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[534,1027,1438,1728,1918,2424,3005,4514],"themes":[22,34,43],"genres":[2,9,31],"first_release_date":875664000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":875664000000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Oct-01","y":1997,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Byzantine: Sırlar Labirenti"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qdufg7jxfvodhafxyr9t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qdufg7jxfvodhafxyr9t","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/um185ojxorwuyf94kaez.jpg","cloudinary_id":"um185ojxorwuyf94kaez","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cg4mfsrjobcvi6cqhul0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cg4mfsrjobcvi6cqhul0","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zansgprjqnswdtjsoyw9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zansgprjqnswdtjsoyw9","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/tvfqztrf8cu8bcuzzun8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tvfqztrf8cu8bcuzzun8","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Aa0F8O4PN8U"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/z4rvtiwjdgtja97dbqwe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z4rvtiwjdgtja97dbqwe","width":800,"height":1033},"esrb":{"rating":3}},{"id":25459,"name":"Five-A-Side Football","slug":"five-a-side-football","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/five-a-side-football","created_at":1478014955355,"updated_at":1478014976315,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":25460,"name":"Against Rome","slug":"against-rome","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/against-rome","created_at":1478014981860,"updated_at":1524450858339,"summary":"Set in Europe at the time of the migration of nations (about 200-450 AD), Against Rome takes the player to that part of the continent that has not yet succumbed to the Roman Empire. This vast territory, which the Romans disparagingly called barbaricum, is the home of numerous primitive nations. The player takes control over one of these barbarian tribes, who as a whole stood out for a pronounced lack of cultural achievements, combined with a ferocious belligerence. Skirmishes, raids and plunderings were the order of the day for these barbarians and are, therefore, the great theme of this game. \n \nBased in a small village, the player and his barbarians roam the vast forests of Germania or the barren steppes of eastern Europe to raid other settlements in their search for food, weapons and gold. These resources will help the barbarian chieftain expand his settlement and, above all, increase his reputation. While his tribe grows and flourishes, the leader obtains fame and experience and grows to be a master of warfare, until the player's barbarian empire is finally ready to take on the superpower of the time - the mighty Roman Empire and its apparently invincible army.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[2015,55036,23345,30229,2617,55029,19077,22399,12982,16125],"tags":[22,268435467,268435471,536871205,536872019,536872248,536874694],"developers":[2257],"publishers":[2006],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[293,1107,1336,3782],"themes":[22],"genres":[11,15],"first_release_date":1083715200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1083715200000,"human":"2004-May-05","y":2004,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e2ase85vspkdj8xpxtbk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e2ase85vspkdj8xpxtbk","width":772,"height":1114}},{"id":25461,"name":"Sister's Secrecy: Arcanum Bloodline - Premium Edition","slug":"sisters-secrecy-arcanum-bloodline-premium-edition","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/sisters-secrecy-arcanum-bloodline-premium-edition","created_at":1478015007850,"updated_at":1478015081120,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":25462,"name":"Wildlife Park Tycoon","slug":"wildlife-park-tycoon","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/wildlife-park-tycoon","created_at":1478015164292,"updated_at":1507799979968,"summary":"A game where you can manage your own zoo.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bxxieibrv7mwqgzvbnq2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bxxieibrv7mwqgzvbnq2","width":500,"height":500}},{"id":25463,"name":"Table Tennis Championship","slug":"table-tennis-championship","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/table-tennis-championship","created_at":1478015188761,"updated_at":1478015209759,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":25464,"name":"3 Days Amulet Secret","slug":"3-days-amulet-secret","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/3-days-amulet-secret","created_at":1478015213438,"updated_at":1478015230260,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":25465,"name":"Reel Deal Slots Adventure III: World Tour","slug":"reel-deal-slots-adventure-iii-world-tour","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/reel-deal-slots-adventure-iii-world-tour","created_at":1478015234977,"updated_at":1478015241798,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":25466,"name":"Ankh 3: Battle of the Gods","slug":"ankh-3-battle-of-the-gods","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/ankh-3-battle-of-the-gods","created_at":1478015288864,"updated_at":1523283521250,"summary":"The omens of the Battle of the Gods have been many, signaling the impending fight for supremacy over all other gods of Egypt.

There are three types of roads to drive on and they are motorway, b-road and dirt and you must avoid hitting the sides and drivers or you lose one of five lives. On the side of the playing area are various dials and these are speedometer, fuel which decreases as you drive, and generator which shows your battery power and decreases if you don't drive full speed. You can also see your mileage driven, lives and if you have your spare tyre. \n \nObstacles you encounter affect different aspects of your car and these are potholes which cause your steering to be erratic, road patches which slow you down, avalanches which means hitting a boulder loses you a life, and you will also encounter crossroads with vehicles moving across the screen which need avoiding. Broken glass means you will stop and your tyre will have to be changed with only one spare tyre, and logs will damage your radiator causing your car to overheat. Gas Stations appear occasionally and here you can refuel, fix your radiator and increase your battery power.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,36608,40470,55192,34919,78315,77742,76119,74758,74016],"tags":[1,268435466,536875069,1073741827],"developers":[10894],"publishers":[1292],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[4157],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/c13yrsbwmukxutwpedxo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c13yrsbwmukxutwpedxo","width":1000,"height":1307}},{"id":25575,"name":"Masquerade","slug":"masquerade","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/masquerade","created_at":1478140861941,"updated_at":1517270762482,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[27725,26163,28148,26223,43130,14136,14605,23175,27266,28277],"tags":[43,268435487,536871130,1073741825],"publishers":[11272,11426],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[218],"themes":[43],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[75,149,152,125,15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":149,"date":499651200000,"region":5,"human":"1985-Nov-01","y":1985,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":125,"date":499651200000,"region":5,"human":"1985-Nov-01","y":1985,"m":11},{"category":2,"platform":152,"date":504835200000,"region":5,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qyvq1pjsclsl67xcr1ca.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qyvq1pjsclsl67xcr1ca","width":1000,"height":1405}},{"id":25576,"name":"Redirection","slug":"redirection","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/redirection","created_at":1478145854748,"updated_at":1523253242453,"summary":"Redirection is a challenging 3D puzzle game set in Outer Space.

Users are allowed to purchase units of virtual currency, Coins, which can be used to purchase virtual furniture, membership of exclusive clubs, or rounds of games. Users will also be able to create their own business and gain a secondary currency called \"experience\". Using this, Sivillians can move up the social and business scale by dominating their market or their area. The Sivillians business will depend on their field of choice and also where they decide to open their first shop. You could sell furniture, have a cafe, have your own Casino* or your even your own hotel just to name a few. The options are endless! \n \nUsers can add friends which they can communicate with via built-in messaging systems, or by inviting the users to the rooms they are in.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[24048,37088,27924,25311,26145,26163,75102,16309,47823,26563],"tags":[33,38,268435468,268435469,536871511,536872384,536872420,536873252,536873304,1073741828,1073741826],"developers":[11436],"publishers":[11436],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[2,5],"keywords":[599,1472,1508,2340,2392],"themes":[33,38],"genres":[12,13],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ib5xjsyckdrcxexz7f6g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ib5xjsyckdrcxexz7f6g","width":414,"height":154}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/l4fiwwhebkc0lietzqyo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l4fiwwhebkc0lietzqyo","width":341,"height":195},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://sivicity.com"}]},{"id":25609,"name":"Beat Nebula","slug":"beat-nebula","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/beat-nebula","created_at":1478427659488,"updated_at":1478427691368,"summary":"In space, everybody can hear you drum.\n\nBeat Nebula is a game for QaziJam8, which had no theme, so I restricted myself to a game that had a limited color palette (based on recently announced Pokémon Cosmog) and to make the game playable on the Donkey Konga bongo controller (which I later expanded to the Taiko Drum Master controller too).

From a top-down perspective, players control a small figure through various aspects of prison life: meals, showers, searches, and violent encounters with guards and other inmates. Players can craft weapons from items (e.g., shivs, stun guns, whips) and are able to use tools (e.g., crowbars, brooms, pickaxes) to engage in melee combat with other characters. Prisoners can pummel each other to gain standing, resulting in dizzy-star effects above fallen opponents. Characters sometimes make suggestive comments while inmates are showering (e.g., “That guard's perving on you”; “We're no strangers to love”; “Caught you looking…”; “Not now, got a headache.”).","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards characters which although human are not very detailed","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/641990"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/TheEscapistsGame"},{"category":1,"url":"https://www.team17.com/games/the-escapists-2/"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/Escapists_Game"},{"category":2,"url":"http://theescapists.gamepedia.com/The_Escapists_2"}],"external":{"steam":"641990"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]},{"id":25654,"name":"Dead of Winter: The Long Night","slug":"dead-of-winter-the-long-night","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dead-of-winter-the-long-night","created_at":1478618181985,"updated_at":1478618192398,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0},{"id":25655,"name":"Franchise Hockey Manager 3","slug":"franchise-hockey-manager-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/franchise-hockey-manager-3","created_at":1478618208574,"updated_at":1523393700061,"summary":"Franchise Hockey Manager 3 is the deepest, most authentic hockey strategy game you can find!

It is themed around World War II-era planes attempting to sink military ships, but there are no references as to which countries are involved in the conflict. \n \nTwo Tigers offers the choice of two separate modes: one or two players working together to sink large enemy ships, or a dogfight mode where two players attempt to down each other's plane. \n \nThe game was not ported to home computers or game consoles. \n \nIn the primary mode, each player steers his or her always moving plane by rotating it clockwise and counter-clockwise. Enemy planes fly horizontally across the screen; shooting them causes them to crash into the warship along the bottom. Each crash damages the ship. Mines floating in the water can be shot, damaging the ship from below. Players can damage the ship directly by dropping bombs. Only one bomb per player can be in the air at once. \n \nRepeated damage to the same location causes a leak. When enough leaks have been created (based on the level), the ship explodes. As an intermission, submarines, sharks, and swimmers occupy the open water and can be shot. After a brief respite, a new ship arrives. \n \nLives are unlimited in Two Tigers. Flying into another plane spawns a replacement once the wreckage falls offscreen. Player-controlled planes are unable to collide with the ship at the bottom. After a certain amount of time an undestroyed ship leaves—another such departure ends the game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,32902,10039,68287,68142,28751,36794,24920],"tags":[1,268435461,268435489,1073741826],"developers":[1436],"publishers":[1436],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rcbnx09x3wxep0zwzbmo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rcbnx09x3wxep0zwzbmo","width":1000,"height":271}},{"id":25668,"name":"Hideous Bill and the Gi-Gants","slug":"hideous-bill-and-the-gi-gants","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hideous-bill-and-the-gi-gants","created_at":1478655060308,"updated_at":1478655060337,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":1,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}]},{"id":25669,"name":"Up 'n Down","slug":"up-n-down","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/up-n-down","created_at":1478658965720,"updated_at":1517270717900,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,36662,51485,58785,29132,40470,24918,13861,51052,47519],"tags":[1,268435466,268435489,536871855,536874337,536875069,536875117,536875955,536877982,1073741826],"developers":[4468],"publishers":[4468],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[943,3425,4157,4205,5043,7070],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,33],"first_release_date":431222400000,"platforms":[68,52,59,13,65,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":431222400000,"region":5,"human":"1983-Sep-01","y":1983,"m":9},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":68,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":567907200000,"region":2,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/foi0gzhamzs0ajsgu29r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"foi0gzhamzs0ajsgu29r","width":1000,"height":1449},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up'n_Down"}]},{"id":25670,"name":"Super Bunny","slug":"super-bunny","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-bunny","created_at":1478659791028,"updated_at":1517271078242,"summary":"A Frogger or Freeway clone written by Vic Leone and published by Datamost for the Apple II, C64 and Atari 8-bit home computers.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,10039,1073,51485,26848,1188,34919,36608,74863,55752],"tags":[1,268435464,536870926,536871814,536873299,536875074,1073741828],"developers":[6403],"publishers":[6403],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,902,2387,4162],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[65,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"The Amazing Adventures of Super Bunny","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o8mie5bmtejkd95wow5r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o8mie5bmtejkd95wow5r","width":1000,"height":1520}},{"id":25671,"name":"Chopper Hunt","slug":"chopper-hunt","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/chopper-hunt","created_at":1478660430822,"updated_at":1517271078284,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,32902,10039,68287,68142,28751,36794,24920],"tags":[1,268435461,268435489,1073741828],"developers":[11480],"publishers":[2522],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[65,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/adp6nnsywrsbtjedjmc2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"adp6nnsywrsbtjedjmc2","width":1000,"height":1341}},{"id":25672,"name":"Yomi wo Saku Hana","slug":"yomi-wo-saku-hana","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/yomi-wo-saku-hana","created_at":1478661803891,"updated_at":1519331757694,"summary":"New title from Experience Inc. set in the same world as Students of the Round and Demon Gaze.

You are the captain of the ship Legacy. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the Warmongers' missile bases but you must also protect your cities. \n \nYou begin the game in command mode. You select your other modes with the joystick. Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for sea-to-land. \n \nNavigation \nIn navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change to the desired mode. \n \nTorpedo \nIf you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode, you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed. \n \nSea-to-land \nIf you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode, you will know you are within range if you see \"Dock for refueling\" on the screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base, position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base, they will shoot missiles at a city. \n \nSea-to-air \nIf a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons satellite. Use you joystick, or the trak-ball , if you plugged one into port 2, to aim at an incoming missile and press fire to blast it. If it gets past you but has not reached your city, you get a \"Refocusing\" message and the view switches to a short range view where you will get one more try. \n \nBe warned that ships can attack you no matter what mode you are in. On the easiest level, there are no hidden bases nor do you use fuel. \n \nThe Atari 5200 version of this game was never released but is however mostly identical to the Atari 8-Bit version that was released.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19934,29173,55590,28751,18623,65832,25311,19301,19847,44076],"tags":[1,268435461,268435469,268435471,268435480,536870913,536871924,536872019,536872060,536874694,536875171,536875242,536875437,536875804,536876737,536877127,536877947,536879058,536879158,536880212,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[190],"publishers":[190],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,1012,1107,1148,3782,4259,4330,4525,4892,5825,6215,7035,8146,8246,9300],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,13,15,24],"first_release_date":504835200000,"platforms":[63,65],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wdndyjqxrep8eewoornz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdndyjqxrep8eewoornz","width":1000,"height":1381}},{"id":25698,"name":"New York City","slug":"new-york-city","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/new-york-city","created_at":1478749039028,"updated_at":1517270813224,"summary":"Traverse the Big Apple and see the sights while avoiding muggers and oncoming traffic in New York City.","popularity":1.0,"games":[36794,36608,34919,51485,22819,40524,51683,24199,23175,16468],"tags":[1,268435489,1073741826],"developers":[9466],"publishers":[9466],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[65,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"NYC: The Big Apple","comment":"Other"},{"name":"N.Y.C.: The Big Apple","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pp9uxix9ix8bjjqfigcp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pp9uxix9ix8bjjqfigcp","width":1000,"height":1375}},{"id":25699,"name":"Atelier Shallie Plus: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea","slug":"atelier-shallie-plus-alchemists-of-the-dusk-sea","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/atelier-shallie-plus-alchemists-of-the-dusk-sea","created_at":1478750490801,"updated_at":1530421375723,"summary":"\"Atelier Shallie Plus -Alchemists of the Dusk Sea-! is based on the third game in the \"Dusk\" series from 2014, \"Atelier Shallie,\" and contains many new features requested by players. \n \nThis new story is centered around the mystery of the \"Dusk,\" presented through the series.

Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. \n \nNow is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther. \n \nAfter consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand. \n \nObjects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly.

To do this he needs the Dragon Amulet, which has been broken into many pieces and scattered across time and space. These pieces must be retrieved and reassembled. Ulrich is too old to undertake the task himself and so has sent his assistant, Kokotoni Wilf, on the mission instead. He has given Wilf magical wings to assist him on his quest.[2] \n \nThe game is a 2D flip-screen platformer. The player must guide Kokotoni Wilf through a series of six levels, all set in different historical eras, in search of the pieces of the amulet (which resemble Stars of David). When all the pieces in a level have been collected a timegate will open (a flashing amulet piece) to allow Wilf to travel to the next era. Wilf's journey begins amid dinosaurs in ancient prehistory and ends amid spaceships and robots in the year 2001. \n \nWilf cannot jump but can fly using his wings. He cannot kill enemies and must evade them instead. \n \nThe game was released in conjunction with a competition by Elite Systems. The Magician's purpose in sending Wilf on his mission is only revealed on completion of the game, and the first hundred people to send this information to Elite won a copy of their next game, The Fall Guy.[1]","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19289,25222,25646,25311,27314,37094,51978,27266,29525,19448],"tags":[1,18,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871939,1073741828],"developers":[1339],"publishers":[1339],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1027],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8,9,31],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iqyynjvyd8x8uuhpphm8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iqyynjvyd8x8uuhpphm8","width":1000,"height":1585}},{"id":25751,"name":"Abribus","slug":"abribus","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/abribus","created_at":1478951001319,"updated_at":1478977087108,"summary":"As a ghost, help people resolve the problems that held them in the limbs by diving into their thoughts.\n\n◉ A zen atmosphere with cute graphics\n◉ Help people reorganizing their thoughts by entering inside their mind\n◉ Features 16 levels, more than 30 different characters and a Time Attack mode","storyline":"As a ghost, help people resolve the problems that held them in the limbs.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,26223,25222,25646,27725,26163,29525,26239,51978,28148],"tags":[43,268435465,268435488,536870928,536871470,536872511,1073741828],"developers":[11521],"game_engines":[404],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[16,558,1599],"themes":[43],"genres":[9,32],"first_release_date":1473379200000,"platforms":[34,82],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1473379200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-09","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":82,"date":1473379200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-09","y":2016,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rswa6kefwy8flalruvga.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rswa6kefwy8flalruvga","width":1281,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rlqtypk7elj4mlokcgl7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rlqtypk7elj4mlokcgl7","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cdafvpuyi54eezwgyuln.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cdafvpuyi54eezwgyuln","width":1023,"height":576}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"O6n7L18q4Qo"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hl81a8vdbi6gldm2yize.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hl81a8vdbi6gldm2yize","width":1920,"height":1080},"esrb":{"synopsis":"As a ghost, help people resolve the problems that held them in the limbs.","rating":3},"pegi":{"synopsis":"As a ghost, help people resolve the problems that held them in the limbs.","rating":1}},{"id":25752,"name":"Le Manoir de L'Étrange","slug":"le-manoir-de-letrange","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/le-manoir-de-letrange","created_at":1478951560991,"updated_at":1478976063794,"summary":"A detective try to understand the unexplained disappearances which happened in a strange manor.","storyline":"A detective try to understand the unexplained disappearances which happened in a strange manor.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,13189,25222,25646,26239,18011,236,29525,27725,28112],"tags":[19,268435488,268435465,268435458,536871127,536871329,536872206,536873151,1073741826],"developers":[11521],"game_engines":[404],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[215,417,1294,2239],"themes":[19],"genres":[2,9,32],"first_release_date":1477872000000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1477872000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Oct-31","y":2016,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1477872000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Oct-31","y":2016,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ht9fkwyo9jsi9brdzehx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ht9fkwyo9jsi9brdzehx","width":1005,"height":561},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qigwum0ckmjjt2fwmqu5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qigwum0ckmjjt2fwmqu5","width":1001,"height":558},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dj7lw2x1czsntudczzng.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dj7lw2x1czsntudczzng","width":1011,"height":563},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ezzhehmttjkz5ur4aklc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ezzhehmttjkz5ur4aklc","width":1008,"height":568}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"aebvu0Cxt6A"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/uzmlx4ji1phqdo62dwmi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uzmlx4ji1phqdo62dwmi","width":1140,"height":661},"esrb":{"synopsis":"A detective try to understand the unexplained disappearances which happened in a strange manor.

Players assume the role of a ranger named Talion as he battles evil forces in a quest for vengeance. Players use swords, arrows, knives, and axes to kill fantastical creatures (e.g., orcs, goblins) in frenetic close-quarter combat. Fighting is highlighted by screams, impact sounds, and blood-splatter effects. Players also have the ability to slit enemies' throats, stab or impale them, and decapitate creatures' heads, which is often seen in slow-motion. Cutscenes also depict instances of intense violence: a woman, teenager, and man executed by having their throats cut; a character beaten to death from a first-person perspective.

Frank Baum's classic story as strongly influenced by MGM's 1939 musical. To a lesser degree, individual levels adapt locations from the 1993 Wizard of Oz Animated Series by DIC by using settings from the series, such as Time Town. \n \nThe game is a platform adventure, which highly encourages exploration. The action is split into four worlds. In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, while in the last rather than gain a companion the witch must be fought. After gaining a companion, the characters may be switched on the fly, and each companion has significantly different attacks and abilities. Several of the levels require using a combination of all of these abilities to fully explore.

First off you choose a dancer to play out of the four possible options, including the two man team of \"Double Trouble\". Warm up mode allows you to test various dance moves. Moves are triggered by joystick directions and use of the fire button. They range from simple moves such as the moonwalk to more complex maneuvers such as the head spin. There is a decent variety of moves available thanks to the same joystick action doing different moves depending on whether you are standing or doing floor moves. The main game portion gives you a time limit in which to perform your moves and rack up points. An energy bar on the left side of the screen diminishes as you do the more complicated moves. In order to regain some energy you can do a simple move such as uprock or the moon walk. Complex floor moves drain energy quickly. If you are close to running out of energy your character will turn red, warning you to shift to something less strenuous. If the energy bar is completely drained, your performance will be over and your dancer noted as being \"beached out\". It is also possible to fail at a hard move, causing your character to sit and cry on the ground, ending your round.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[37067,22690,34919,55715,36608,16468,14713,23175,59516,55077],"tags":[1,268435463,268435470,536872611,536875049,536875486,536882767,1073741826],"publishers":[10478],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1699,4137,4574,11855],"themes":[1],"genres":[7,14],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xywcuqoj46nzzeyk9k16.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xywcuqoj46nzzeyk9k16","width":1000,"height":1545}},{"id":25784,"name":"Rayman 10th Anniversary","slug":"rayman-10th-anniversary","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-10th-anniversary","created_at":1479035543019,"updated_at":1479035972287,"summary":"A bundle pack including Rayman M, Rayman Revolution and Rayman 3","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":3,"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h9qkh5ifjhid9fj0mukx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h9qkh5ifjhid9fj0mukx","width":354,"height":500}},{"id":25785,"name":"Polygonauts","slug":"polygonauts","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/polygonauts","created_at":1479066952284,"updated_at":1479070028162,"summary":"We know that your video-card handles thousands of polygons per second, but can you take care of a single polygon lost in a bizarre land, far away from home?\n\nPolygonauts is an upcoming puzzle / platformer indie game for PC (Linux, Windows and Mac) presented in neat 2D graphics.

Click here to go to the Smoke and Mirrors Wikipedia page. Here is an excerpt regarding Desert Bus:\n\nThe objective of the game is to drive a bus from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada in real time at a maximum speed of 45mph. The feat requires 8 hours of continuous play to complete, since the game cannot be paused.\n\nThe bus contains no passengers, and there is no scenery or other traffic on the road. The bus veers to the right slightly; as a result, it is impossible to tape down a button to go do something else and have the game end properly. If the bus veers off the road it will stall and be towed back to Tucson, also in real time. If the player makes it to Las Vegas, they will score exactly one point. The player then gets the option to make the return trip to Tucson庸or another point (a decision they must make in a few seconds or the game ends). Players may continue to make trips and score points as long as their endurance holds out. Some players who have completed the trip have also noted that, although the scenery never changes, a bug splats on the windscreen about five hours through the first trip, and on the return trip the light does fade, with differences at dusk, and later a pitch black road where the player is guided only with headlights.\n\nPenn Jillette commented in his radio show that the overly realistic nature of the game was in response to Janet Reno and the controversy surrounding violent video games at the time.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[40470,44242,54789,18623,22470,29173,25443,26145,22425,55689],"tags":[268435466,268435469,536872060,536875069,536880165,1073741825],"developers":[1731],"publishers":[1000],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1148,4157,9253],"genres":[10,13],"first_release_date":820368000000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[34,78],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1321228800000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Nov-14","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":2,"platform":78,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hrdyyoyzxhi5fvv7fcn8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hrdyyoyzxhi5fvv7fcn8","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gin4wrr06z8ej0dhxvha.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gin4wrr06z8ej0dhxvha","width":414,"height":334},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://desertbus-game.org/"}]},{"id":25793,"name":"Quur","slug":"quur","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/quur","created_at":1479116860962,"updated_at":1479116890412,"summary":"Violence is not always your best option.\n\nIn a world sustained by a magical liquid, called the Color, you embody an ethereal being capable of manipulating it.\nEvery action you take will have a direct impact on the forest of Quur and on the creatures who inhabit it.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741826],"developers":[11542],"publishers":[11542],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1475193600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":5,"platform":6,"date":1475193600000,"human":"2016-Q3","y":2016,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k3ydnczhyxu7yq0hp9z0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k3ydnczhyxu7yq0hp9z0","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mz2kejnia6de8ksda7n1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mz2kejnia6de8ksda7n1","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"hHMjG5Po4C8"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/efftetxczli99aco70zt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"efftetxczli99aco70zt","width":903,"height":1200},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https://lucie-viatge.itch.io/quur"}]},{"id":25794,"name":"Hakuouki: Kyoto Winds","slug":"hakuouki-kyoto-winds","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/hakuouki-kyoto-winds","created_at":1479121536617,"updated_at":1479121563894,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"pulse_count":1},{"id":25795,"name":"Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers","slug":"cartoon-network-battle-crashers","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/cartoon-network-battle-crashers","created_at":1479121577582,"updated_at":1534520801350,"summary":"\"When Uncle Grandpa accidentally drives the UG-RV through multiple dimensions, he picks up some surprise passengers in the form of Gumball, Steven Universe, Finn, Mordecai and Clarence!

Wizard's ROM takes up 2K, the last Atari 2600 game programmed by Atari Inc. to use such a small amount. \n \nThe player plays as a wizard from Irata (Atari spelled backwards) and battles Imps. It takes place in a maze, but it's not a symmetric battle: the player is faster than the enemy, but the enemy can go through walls and fire faster than the player can. \n \nWizard was innovative in several ways. There was no need to aim, as the angle of the player's fire was automatically sent in the direction of the player's enemy.

It was released in 1982 as a clone of the Scramble arcade game. \n \nIn Penetrator, the gamer flies a ship, which can shoot forwards and drop bombs beneath the ship. The first level is on open air, with just mountains to dodge, missiles which try to hit the ship, and animated radars. From the second level onwards, the game is inside increasingly complex caverns, so the ceiling is also a danger, as well as new enemies - the missiles are now sometimes replaced with skulls that can move up and down, blocking the path. \n \nThe levels change with no pause, only the screen colour changes. After four levels there is a short fifth level where a base needs to be destroyed by dropping a bomb precisely, and then there is a firework animation as a reward. After all levels are finished, the ship goes back through inversed levels, with backward turned landscape. \n \nReviews at the time said that graphics and the game were impressive, even stunning.[1] \n \nThere is an edit mode for designing levels, and a training mode with infinite number of lives in which one can start from any level. Also, there is a simultaneous two-player mode. The game's sound consisted of a characteristic uplifting theme before ship launch, while in-game there were simultaneous shooting/explosion effects, which was relatively advanced use of the limited one channel Spectrum beeper system at the time. \n \nLater, versions for Commodore 64 and TRS-80 appeared.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,28029,27314,64204,142,71455,25300,27523,11253],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871859,536871882,536871937,536871971,536875262,536876028,536876578,1073741828],"developers":[804],"publishers":[1985],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[947,970,1025,1059,4350,5116,5666],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[126,15,26],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":126,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":410140800000,"region":1,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yhm91tx7rlikcqfrc1th.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yhm91tx7rlikcqfrc1th","width":1000,"height":1448}},{"id":25837,"name":"The Pedestrian","slug":"the-pedestrian","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-pedestrian","created_at":1479301325977,"updated_at":1523393290267,"summary":"The Pedestrian is a 2.5D puzzle platformer that takes “puzzle platforming” literally.

Hanson and published by Mindscape for the Commodore 64. The game is based on the Indiana Jones series, and was released in North America around January 1985, while a U.K. version was released in March 1985. \n \nGameplay requires the player to think like fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones to solve the puzzles of each level, as the game does not provide the player with any rules or gameplay information; the game's cover advertised, \"Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you.\" \n \nIndiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom features six levels played across a \"Lost Kingdom.\" Playing as Indiana Jones, the player must solve a puzzle in each level to progress through the game. The player's ultimate goal is to retrieve a valuable artifact that contains the secrets of a lost civilization, before Jones' arch-rival, Ivar Reiss, can take it for himself. Indiana Jones is armed only with a mystical cane, and must battle against numerous enemies and perils throughout the game, including bats, monsters, steep cliffs, twisting mazes, and \"killer snowflakes\". Joystick movements vary between each level, requiring the player to relearn the control scheme throughout the game. A two-player option is also available. \n \nNo rules or gameplay information is provided to the player, who is left to use logic and intuition to solve each puzzle, as Indiana Jones would. Solving each puzzle requires the player to pay close attention to subtle changes in each level's surroundings or musical score, as well as other possibilities, testing the player's \"Indiana Jones Quotient\" (IJQ). However, the game's instruction manual does feature clues at the bottom of each page. Each clue is presented as a hieroglyphic, and must be deciphered by the player using a magic viewer, similar to 3D glasses. A \"clue hotline\" was also available for players, providing them with pre-recorded hints on how to finish each level.","collection":2019,"franchise":2,"franchises":[2],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,25646,10039,37094,1073,51485,26848,1188,19289,58479],"tags":[1,268435464,268435465,536873017,536875778,1073741826],"publishers":[11247],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[2105,4866],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,9],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g4qsls8u1jbjdyshnpzl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g4qsls8u1jbjdyshnpzl","width":1000,"height":1197}},{"id":25863,"name":"Paul Pixel - The Awakening","slug":"paul-pixel-the-awakening","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/paul-pixel-the-awakening","created_at":1479415395764,"updated_at":1523364682241,"summary":"An ordinary guy forced to defend the world from an alien invasion of infectious zombies.

Stratosphere focuses on floating island battles which players control.\n\nGameplay consist of the player controlling a single floating island which are called flying fortresses in the game. These fortresses float because they are built from 'floatstones' which can be collected from mountainsides and also from other fortresses after damaging them. There are three types of floatstones each used to build different structures on the fortress. Extra land can be added to the fortress but at a limit of its fortress size class.\n\nThrough the build view, fortresses can build structures that increases maneuverability such as thrusters for moving forwards and backwards, and side thrusters to rotate the fortress. The amount of these maneuverability structures determine the power.

Players compete for controlling these rooms by mining resources, developing infrastructure, and commanding armies.\n\nScreeps can also be called a sandbox game for programmers since it has no definite goals. Instead, it offers players a fully programmable game world, means to interact with each other within it, and JavaScript API to control game objects. This allows for many possible outcomes for each player and an open-ended nature of the game.","rating":80.0,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":80.0,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[29173,16125,23345,55590,19376,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015],"tags":[33,268435467,268435471,268435488,536871860,536872407,536874694,1073741827],"developers":[11605],"publishers":[11605],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,5],"keywords":[948,1495,3782],"themes":[33],"genres":[11,15,32],"first_release_date":1479254400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,92,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1479254400000,"region":1,"human":"2016-Nov-16","y":2016,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1479254400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Nov-16","y":2016,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1479254400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Nov-16","y":2016,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1479254400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Nov-16","y":2016,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1479254400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Nov-16","y":2016,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qo7ppaxmlu5mfbqjb0rh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qo7ppaxmlu5mfbqjb0rh","width":1034,"height":814},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ezixjonyp8tuwvjqligf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ezixjonyp8tuwvjqligf","width":782,"height":521},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ka6lw6sputsnw0jkrclo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ka6lw6sputsnw0jkrclo","width":839,"height":839},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gunmt0k8v546i7nrefhg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gunmt0k8v546i7nrefhg","width":523,"height":443},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ubevfi7fk61aqhagmsmg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ubevfi7fk61aqhagmsmg","width":767,"height":698}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qs4fkuktdrewiuvmmcx5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qs4fkuktdrewiuvmmcx5","width":323,"height":323},"external":{"steam":"464350"}},{"id":25904,"name":"Two Way","slug":"two-way","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/two-way","created_at":1479685186162,"updated_at":1504283659622,"summary":"With Two Way you have a limited number of bounces and touch to complete the level\n\n\n● 70 Levels\n● Completely free\n● Smoothness\n● New way of game play\n● Nice graphic\n● Update Weekly\n● Need To use your mind to win of levels\n\n\nTwitter :https://twitter.com/StudioFreez\nfacebook:https://www.facebook.com/NeedRunFreezTime/\n\n\nContact us if there's any problem.

The purpose of the game is to manage the flights that are presented to the player without the flights being delayed or exiting/landing in the wrong location. The aircraft either come flying in on the screen and have preset exit or landing points or show up as wanting to take off with an exit point. It is the player's job to determine the route each aircraft flies and when they may land or take off. \n \nThe aircraft cannot be too close to each other, so the player needs to make sure that they are passing each other on different flight levels or with sufficient distance (three grid dots north/south or east/west) between them. When an aircraft is in danger of crashing or is exiting at the wrong location or altitude, the aircraft will inform the air traffic controller. Aircraft do not change course/altitude unless the player tells them to. Incoming aircraft not given clearance to land, however, will go into a holding pattern and wait until given clearance. When necessary, the player can also give holding instructions to aircraft, as long as their course takes them over a VOR tower which is used as the holding fix. \n \nTo start with, there are few flights at the same time, but at higher GS levels, there are many flights that need management at the same time. Also storms which the aircraft can not pass through show up and some aircraft have very little fuel and have to land fast or they will crash.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,44242,55689,55590,40470,18623,9199,22470,11679,26145],"tags":[32,268435469,536871904,536871906,536872060,1073741827],"developers":[9150],"publishers":[9150],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[992,994,1148],"themes":[32],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":504835200000,"platforms":[63,65,16,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hr2hitodt8deivlgopyv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hr2hitodt8deivlgopyv","width":1000,"height":1437}},{"id":25921,"name":"Atelier Firis: The Alchemist and the Mysterious Journey","slug":"atelier-firis-the-alchemist-and-the-mysterious-journey","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/atelier-firis-the-alchemist-and-the-mysterious-journey","created_at":1479839867149,"updated_at":1530424986797,"summary":"The 18th core Atelier game and the second in the Mysterious series.","collection":2523,"franchise":900,"franchises":[900],"rating":80.0,"popularity":40.66666666666666,"aggregated_rating":76.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":10,"total_rating":78.33333333333334,"total_rating_count":11,"rating_count":1,"games":[27092,26765,55092,81249,18398,11169,47158,36534,12632,47823],"tags":[17,28,268435468,268435471,268435487,536870990,536871208,536871433,536871938,536873302,536873311,536873580,1073741826],"developers":[3046],"publishers":[858,6066,7445],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,296,521,1026,2390,2399,2668],"themes":[17,28],"genres":[12,15,31],"first_release_date":1478044800000,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[6,46,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1488844800000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Mar-07","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1489104000000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Mar-10","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1489104000000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Mar-10","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1488844800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Mar-07","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1488844800000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Mar-07","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1478044800000,"region":5,"human":"2016-Nov-02","y":2016,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1478044800000,"region":5,"human":"2016-Nov-02","y":2016,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Firis no Atelier: Fushigi na Tabi no Renkinjutsushi","comment":"Other"},{"name":"フィリスのアトリエ ～不思議な旅の錬金術士～","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e14xu7y7hcgcnqj6ucqh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e14xu7y7hcgcnqj6ucqh","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bxr5prvkattnwt1vcchc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bxr5prvkattnwt1vcchc","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a1jvhfutiyy3w7audukw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a1jvhfutiyy3w7audukw","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ulaf82zout8rtzxvprrk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ulaf82zout8rtzxvprrk","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xejvsvyobdop1s7s4hwq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xejvsvyobdop1s7s4hwq","width":670,"height":415}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"iFD6IQJDCCo"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hbqas0uveynmyddwlozr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hbqas0uveynmyddwlozr","width":640,"height":801},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of Firis, an adventurous girl on a quest to become an alchemist.

Es gibt sogar ein Review zu diesem \"Spiel\"?\"\nDas oder etwas ähnliches wird sich vermutlich der Großteil der Leser denken. Ja, auch du. Gib's ruhig zu.\n\nAlte Macht hat in der deutschen RPG-Maker Community den Ruf weg die trashigste Serie in der Community zu sein. Nun, also eigentlich, um genau zu sein: Ja, das ist sie vermutlich auch. Viele werden diese Serie als das schlimmste ansehen, was es auf dieser Seite zu finden gibt, einige wenige werden in die Serie Dinge hineninterpretieren die sie gut und durchdacht erscheinen lässt und einige wenige mögen die Serie vielleicht sogar (ich zähle mich übrigens wirklich zu letzteren). Aber was davon ist nun wahr?\n\nDie Story Beschreibung ist nicht sonderlich vielsagend. Ein Mann namens Kai verschont bei einem Angriff auf eine Stadt ein Mädchen namen Lilie. Als sein Anführer das erfährt will er beide tot sehen, so kommt es dazu, dass Kai und Lilie gemeinsam fliehen müssen.\nAuf ihrer Reise treffen sie auf allerlei Gefährten und kommen an vielerlei Orte, nehmen es mit gefährlichen Feinden auf und retten am Ende sogar die Welt.\n\nNun, so toll sich das auch anhören mag und so viel man da auch rein interpretieren kann, Fakt ist: \nDie Umsetzung ist gelinde gesagt miserabel. \n\nEigentlich verkörpert Alte Macht alles was ein gutes RPG nicht haben sollte. Das Mapping ist mies, die Rechtschreibung grausig, die Dialogführung so langweilig und undurchdacht dass überhaupt keine Stimmung aufkommt und das Balancing total verkorkst. Wieso also sollte man sich so ein Spiel überhaupt anschauen?\nNun, zum einen wäre da die Tatsache, dass das Spiel durchaus ein paar nette Ideen und Spielereien hat. So gibt es beispielweise einige Nebenquests die man recht früh beginnen kann und die sich durch das ganze Spiel ziehen. Auch kann man an einigen Orten \"Trainigsareale\" vorfinden wo man gegen bestimmte Monstergruppen kämpfen kann um sich zu trainieren. Leider Gottes ist aber auch hier die Umsetzung mehr schlecht als recht. \nZum anderen... nun, Alte Macht hat nicht umsonst den Ruf als trashigste Serie weg. Es ist trashig und vielleicht verpasst gerade dass dieser Serie ihren ganz eigenen Charme. Ebenfalls ist Alte Macht aufgrund der recht geringen Spielzeit von nur einigen wenigen Stunden und der Tatsache, dass es vollkommen unkompliziert ist gut um zwischendurch einfach mal etwas, nunja, \"einfaches\" und \"banales\" zu spielen. Um mal abzuschalten.\nWas man dem Spiel ebenfalls anrechnen muss ist die Tatsache, dass einige Bosse (in den späteren Teilen ein Großteil der Bosse) aus mehreren Teilen verschiedenster Monster zusammengesetzt sind. Und meistens - wenn auch noch nicht unbedingt in diesem ersten Teil - sieht das sogar ziemlich gut aus. Es gibt kaum Makerspiele in denen so etwas überhaupt mal vorkommt.\nAuch interessant anzusehen ist natürlich wie sich der Entwickler über die Jahre hinweg weiterentwickelt hat - doch genaueres dazu dann in potenziell irgendwann mal erscheinenden Reviews zu den Nachfolgern.\n\n\nFazit (wenn man sowas hier überhaupt geben kann, ähem. xD)\nAlte Macht macht eigentlich wirklich alles falsch was man falsch machen kann und EIGENTLICH sollte jeder der kein Liebhaber des Trashs ist einen großen Bogen um das Spiel machen, aber irgendwie (und ich kenne zumindest noch eine andere Person die das genauso sieht! xD) macht es doch Spaß sich durch das Spiel zu prügeln.\n\nWer sich diese Serie also wirklich mal näher ansehen möchte: Tut euch keinen Zwang an, aber erwartet nicht zu viel (oder besser noch, erwartet lieber gleich gar nichts).\nAlle anderen (was dann wohl den Großteil ausmacht) sollten lieber einen Bogen um Alte Macht, insbesonderes diesen ersten Teil, machen. Nutzt eure Zeit anderweitig, zum Beispiel indem ihr spaßige Reviews für diese Seite schreibt! Oder, öhm, ein Heilmettel gegen Krebs findet.
